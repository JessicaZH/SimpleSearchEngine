List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council - Wikipedia List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Consultative Status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is the highest status granted by the United Nations to non-governmental organizations (NGO's), thereby allowing them to participate in the work of the United Nations. Consultative Status is divided into three categories: General Consultative Status (formerly Consultative Status 1), the highest level, which may be granted to organizations that are concerned with most of the activities of the Council, that are making substantive and sustained contributions in many fields, with a considerable membership, and that are broadly representative of major segments of society in a large number of countries. These organizations are entitled to deliver oral presentations during the Council's meetings. Special Consultative Status (formerly Consultative Status 2), which may be granted to organizations concerned with only a few of the fields of activity covered by the Council Roster, which are "other organizations that do not have general or special consultative status but that the Council, or the Secretary-General of the United Nations in consultation with the Council or its Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations, considers can make occasional and useful contributions to the work of the Council." Twice a year, the United Nations Committee on Non-Governmental Organizations reviews new applications for consultative status and makes recommendations to the ECOSOC, which reviews and decides to approve or deny the recommendations. Almost always, these recommendations are approved. Consultative Status, depending on level, gives the organizations a number of rights to participate in the work of the UN, to present their views and deliver testimony.[1] The first time that non-governmental organizations were granted consultative status was in 1946, when 41 organizations were chosen.[2] By 1996, over 1000 NGO's were granted consultative status, and by the year 2000, there were 2050.[3] As of July 2018, there are a total of 5,081 organizations in consultative status with ECOSOC. There are 134 organizations in general consultative status, 3,974 in special consultative status and 973 on the Roster.[4] The UN also maintains a database through which the current set of organizations in consultative status can be accessed.[5] A list of all of the organizations, in pdf format, is also available.[6] Contents 1 General Consultative Status 2 Special Consultative Status 3 Roster Status 4 References 5 External links General Consultative Status[edit] This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it.
