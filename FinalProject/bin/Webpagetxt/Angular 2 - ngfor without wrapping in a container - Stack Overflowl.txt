Home Public Stack Overflow Tags Users Jobs Teams+Slack Q&A for work Learn More Angular 2 - ngfor without wrapping in a container Ask Question up vote 32 down vote favorite 2 I wish the have a ul element and then in my json I have html containing list (li) elements from various social media sites.. when I put ngfor on the list items is creates multiple ul's for each of the outputted json records.. is it possible just to output each of the li's as plain html and not wrap them in an element small sample of my json {
    "courses": [{
        "tile_id": 0,
        "tile_content": "<li class=\"grid-item horiz-double blog-tile\" data-item-id=\"0\">yrdy<\/li>"
    }],
}
 small sample of my angular service - this works perfectly and outputs the json but maybe im missing some kind of formatting setting public getCourses() {

    this._http.get(this.apiUrl).map(response => response.json()).subscribe(data => {
        // console.log( data.courses );
        this._dataStore.courses = data.courses;

        // console.log(this._coursesObserverXX);

        this._coursesObserverXX.next(this._dataStore.courses);

    }, error => console.log('Could not load courses.'));

}
 and my html <ul class="list-group" *ngFor="#course of courses | async">
      {{ course.tile_content }}
</ul>
 the goal is to not have the ngfor output a wrapper and also to display the output as plain html rather than plaintext as it appears to come out angular share|improve this question edited Jun 12 at 18:23 Jacob Stamm 371629 asked May 3 '16 at 13:05 Kravitz 5434826 add a comment | 3 Answers 3 active oldest votes up vote 3 down vote accepted You can use outerHTML <ul class="list-group" >
  <li *ngFor="let course of courses | async" [outerHtml]="course.tile_content"></li>
</ul>
 Plunker example share|improve this answer edited Oct 17 '17 at 8:35 answered May 3 '16 at 13:09 Günter Zöchbauer 307k64909856 Not quite what im after.. you see the li tag will be supplied by the json result - I essentially need to dump the json between the ul tags as raw html – Kravitz May 3 '16 at 13:17 Sorry, forgot to move the *ngFor to the <li> element. Now it produces the expected HTML. – Günter Zöchbauer May 3 '16 at 13:19 Did you check the Plunker? It's now generating <li> that are not wrapped with <ul> – Günter Zöchbauer May 3 '16 at 13:45 Cheers man, I ended up using this as a base point and scrapped the idea of creating a new directive. – Kravitz May 3 '16 at 14:48 add a comment | up vote 98 down vote In some cases, <ng-container> may be useful. Like (not for this specific question): <ng-container *ngFor="let item of items; let i = index">
  ...
</ng-container>
 In the DOM, its content is rendered as usual, but the tag itself is rendered as an HTML comment. From the documentation: Group sibling elements with <ng-container> [...] <ng-container> to the rescue The Angular <ng-container> is a grouping element that doesn't interfere with styles or layout because Angular doesn't put it in the DOM. share|improve this answer edited May 23 '17 at 12:26 Community♦ 11 answered Dec 18 '16 at 15:53 Arjan 16.3k74662 add a comment | up vote 5 down vote Not sure to understand what you want / try to do but you can do something like this: <ul class="list-group">
  <li *ngFor="#course of courses | async">
    {{ course.tile_content }}
  </li>
</ul>
 Note that the expanded syntax could also be used: <template ngFor [ngForOf]="courses | async" #course>
  {{ course.tile_content }}
</template>
 (the template tag won't be added into the HTML) Edit This works: <ul *ngFor="#elt of elements | async" [innerHTML]="elt.title">
</ul>

Using the innerHTML attribute is possible at the level of the ngFor ;-) I updated my answer... – Thierry Templier May 3 '16 at 13:19 I added a plunkr demonstrating this – Thierry Templier May 3 '16 at 13:20 Thanks dude, so I made a new directive and this is working for me @Component({ selector: 'social-wall', template: <template ngFor [ngForOf]="socialwall | async" #social > {{ social.tile_content }} </template>, }) but its not plain html any idea how i work that in at this level – Kravitz May 3 '16 at 13:56 I think that the innerHTML attribute is what you should use. It will allow you to render the HTML... – Thierry Templier May 3 '16 at 14:04 | show 1 more comment Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!
