After March 2016, the score will consist of the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section + Math section. All freshman applicants to UNT must submit SAT or ACT scores. The writing portion of the exam is not required. In addition, state law TEC 51.803-51.809, Uniform Admissions Policy (UAP) requires applicants to four-year public universities to meet college readiness standards through completion of a high school graduation program or equivalent or through SAT or ACT score benchmarks. If you attend an out-of-state high school, you are exempt from the UAP. Students must meet one of the following college readiness standards in order to be eligible for consideration for admission at a Texas Four-Year Public Institution: Successfully complete the Foundation (HB5), Foundation with Endorsements (HB5), Distinguished Achievement (HB5), Minimum (UAP), Recommended (UAP) or Distinguished (UAP) high school program or complete the portion of the program that was available to them;or Successfully complete a curriculum that is equivalent* in content and rigor to the Foundation, Foundation with Endorsements, Distinguished Achievement, Minimum (UAP), Recommended or Advanced (Distinguished Achievement) high school program at a high school that is exempt from offering such programs; or *Equivalencies must be documented by the student’s high school. Satisfy the College Readiness Benchmarks on the SAT or ACT assessment SAT - 1500 out of 2400 (for tests prior to March 2016) or 1090 out of 1600 (for tests March 2016 to present) ACT - 18 English, 22 Reading, 22 Mathematics and 23 Science If you meet the state requirements for SAT/ACT score or curriculum listed above, but don’t meet UNT’s admission requirements, your application will be reviewed individually by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Individual Review of Application Individual Review is a process whereby a UNT Admissions Counselor reviews the application file of any freshman or transfer student who does not possess an official high school rank or otherwise does not meet the minimum automatic or regular admission requirements. This review is an automatic process whenever the Office of Undergraduate Admissions determines that an applicant does not meet official UNT minimum entrance requirements. Upon review of the application file, the Admissions Counselor will forward a letter to the student stating the options for possible admission to UNT. These options may include: Submitting new entrance exam scores (SAT or ACT); Attending a community college and completing 30 or more college level hours with a minimum 2.25 GPA; Duplicating college level work in which the student received a "D" or "F" to improve college GPA; Submitting three letters of recommendation and an essay (personal statement) addressing their education and career goals. Students should carry out the suggested option for the best possibility of admission into UNT. Factors that may assist in determining academic readiness under the individual review provision may include, but are not limited to, the following: high school attended; first-generation college attendance; employment experience; special abilities such as bilingual proficiency and meeting family responsibilities; individual achievements; leadership activities; public service; and extra-curricular activities. Additional Information for Non-Traditional Applicants Early College High School (ECHS) We understand that as an ECHS student, you are not the same as most incoming freshmen, so it makes sense that your admissions process should be a little different too. UNT has Admissions Counselors who can help ECHS students with planning, transferring your credits and admissions. Find out more about ECHS admissions requirements Homeschooled Students UNT recognizes home school programs and works with homeschooled students in their admission to the university. Homeschooled students must submit an official copy of their high school transcript along with their SAT and/or ACT scores. Each homeschool applicant is reviewed on a case by case basis. In addition, homeschooled students must take the Texas Success Initiative (TSI) assessment prior to registering for courses. The TSI Assessment cannot be used in admissions decisions at UNT, but is necessary for adequate preregistration advising. For more information on the TSI Assessment, please visit UNT Learning Center's TSI web page or call at 940-369-7006. GED Students who have earned a GED (and who either have not attended college or, if so, have earned fewer than 30 semester hours of transferable college work) may seek admission to UNT through an Individual Review process. Learn how to apply for admission to UNT if you have earned your GED Early Admission On an individual basis, UNT may admit high school students to the freshman class after completion of the junior year of high school. To be considered, students must: be ranked in the top quarter of their class; have a strong B average; have completed 3 units of English and 3 units each of solid mathematics, social science and natural science; present minimum combined SAT (combined critical reading/verbal + math) score of 1180 or ACT composite of 26; submit letters from high school counselor or principal recommending early admission; submit a letter from parents or guardians stating they approve of early admission; and arrange an interview in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Under this program, high school seniors may be enrolled concurrently at UNT through coordination with the UNT Director of Admissions and the high school. Adult Admission Program Freshman applicants who have been out of high school for at least five years and who have earned fewer than 30 semester hours at a college or university may be eligible for admission to UNT under the Adult Admission Program.
