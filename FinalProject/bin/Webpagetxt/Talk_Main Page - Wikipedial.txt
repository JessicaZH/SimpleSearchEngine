Errors in the summary of today's or tomorrow's featured article[edit] TFA today[edit] TFA tomorrow[edit] " The battle had little strategic impact, and the Japanese were unable to recapture Guadalcanal from Allied forces." It was the first of a series of failures to resupply Japanese troops that lead to their abandoning the islands, that seems a very significant strategic impact. Literally nobody knows what the effect might have been if the Japanese forces had been successfully supplied, so ridiculous and unsustainable to say that this had little strategic impact. Kevin McE (talk) 07:54, 29 November 2018 (UTC) Still recusing while I talk things over with the coords. - Dank (push to talk) 14:32, 29 November 2018 (UTC) It's kind of complicated. The article says that this particular battle was a Japanese tactical victory, but it had little strategic impact; I interpret that to mean it didn't result in a change to the strategic status quo. Which seems to be true. Any suggested rewording? I won't lose too much sleep if it makes it to the main page in an hour like this, but if can be easily improved... --Floquenbeam (talk) 23:02, 29 November 2018 (UTC) Errors in In the news[edit] Errors in today's or tomorrow's On this day[edit] OTD today[edit] OTD tomorrow[edit] Errors in the current or next Did you know...[edit] DYK current[edit] DYK next[edit] Errors in today's or tomorrow's featured picture[edit] POTD today[edit] POTD tomorrow[edit] Errors in the summary of the last or next featured list[edit] FL current[edit] FL next[edit] General discussion[edit] Shortcuts T:MP WT:MP Requested move 24 October 2018[edit] The following is a closed discussion of a requested move. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. Editors desiring to contest the closing decision should consider a move review after discussing it on the closer's talk page. No further edits should be made to this section. No consensus. See no agreement below to move this out of templatespace, and there is some apprehension about possible technical issues. As is usual with a no-consensus outcome, editors may find rebuttals to those apprehensions and come back in a few weeks to try to garner consensus for the rename. Have a Great Day and Happy Publishing! (nac by page mover) Paine Ellsworth, ed. put'r there 16:35, 21 November 2018 (UTC) Template:Main Page/styles.css → Wikipedia:Main Page/styles.css – Not a subtemplate of {{Main Page}} (a redirect to {{Main Page toolbox}}), but instead of the actual main page. Main-page-related cruft tends to get put in Wikipedia namespace, so the CSS page should go there too. {{3x|p}}ery (talk) 01:18, 24 October 2018 (UTC) --Relisting. Iffy★Chat -- 14:09, 2 November 2018 (UTC) TemplateStyles CSS pages must have the sanitized-css content model to function, and only .css pages in the template namespace have that by default. I think it will keep the content model if moved outside of the template namespace, but if not, an admin can change it with Special:ChangeContentModel. (No opinion on which namespace is most appropriate, but when creating it, Template was the only option.) --Yair rand (talk) 02:55, 24 October 2018 (UTC) Comment - did not understand Yair rand's comment, nor do I understand what this "template" does as it has no documentation, but if indeed it's not a subtemplate of {{Main Page}}, then this clearly needs to be moved to a different name. --Gonnym (talk) 09:18, 24 October 2018 (UTC) Gonnym, Wikipedia:TemplateStyles may help you understand the comment. In short, the template will store the CSS rules which will be used to style the main page using the TemplateStyles extension of MediaWiki. Personally I would prefer that the Main Page be replaced with {{Main Page}} and all the markup be moved to Template:Main Page which is what Wikidata and Commons do. However, I think that I am among a minority. — fr + 10:13, 24 October 2018 (UTC) I have added this comment to the top of the CSS page to help clarify it (To any admin: feel free to improve my wording.) Remember, the Main Page is unique in that it is in the main article namespace, but is used like a portal, whose content is largely generated by templates. Unless there are modifications elsewhere (such as using Special:ChangeContentModel), my understanding is that a TemplateStyles CSS page must currently remain in the template namespace for it to function properly. Zzyzx11 (talk) 04:12, 25 October 2018 (UTC) Counterexample: Module:Citation/CS1/styles.css. {{3x|p}}ery (talk) 02:12, 30 October 2018 (UTC) Comment the mainpage is a portal, so shouldn't it be Portal:Main Page/styles.css ? -- 65.94.42.18 (talk) 03:54, 26 October 2018 (UTC) No, because that would be inconsistent with Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow, Wikipedia:Main Page/sandbox, etc. {{3x|p}}ery (talk) 04:03, 26 October 2018 (UTC) Oppose Zero benefit. This is similar argument to mainpage being in article space and attempt to move it being consistently shot down. Wikipedia:Main Page/styles.css is also wrong, since mainpage is not in the project namespace, unless you can move it to Main Page/styles.css, then template namespace is the only and best place for it. –Ammarpad (talk) 05:43, 31 October 2018 (UTC) Support better place to put it than the template space. Keeps everything as sub pages of one page. Galobtter (pingó mió) 05:51, 31 October 2018 (UTC) Oppose Not only is there no benefit but it is supposed to be a template and not a page Abote2 (talk) 12:11, 4 November 2018 (UTC) Tentative support. As noted above, most of the non-mainspace pages related to the Main Page are in projectspace, and I don't see why this should be different; it helps to put everything together. "Tentative" because maybe moving this page across namespaces would cause technical problems (as it would if we moved the aforementioned module, for example), and of course it's more important to avoid breaking something than to have everything in the same general area. Nyttend (talk) 01:52, 5 November 2018 (UTC) Bumping thread to prevent archival. {{3x|p}}ery (talk) 03:07, 12 November 2018 (UTC) I added {{Do not archive until}} to the top of this section to prevent archival.

Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on this talk page or in a move review. No further edits should be made to this section. We got a new low here....[edit] If you have problems with DYK hooks, then head on over to WT:DYK. Stephen 21:37, 25 November 2018 (UTC) The following discussion is closed. Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page. No further edits should be made to this discussion. Did you know...that the French submarine Amazone was named after a mythological tribe of women warriors? ...Amazon? Ya think? Goatse there was a positive edit, compared to this. Qwirkle (talk) 03:29, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Think more global, because not everyone who reads the main page watched Wonder Woman or Xena when they were kids. Paine Ellsworth, ed. put'r there 13:59, 24 November 2018 (UTC) And it's not remotely obvious that it was named after the tribe, even if one did spend one's childhood watching "Wonder Woman", given that the US Navy—the navy with which en-wiki readers are most likely to be familiar—has a convention that certain classes of ship are always named after rivers, so it wouldn't be unreasonable for readers to assume the French follow the same convention. ‑ Iridescent 14:17, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Ahh, so you are defending one piece of trivial fluff by pointing out that it could have been based on different trivial fluff. Kewl. Qwirkle (talk) 16:18, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Even if it were named after the river, said river is named after the tribe, so the submarine would still be indirectly named after the tribe. Anything named "Amazon" traces back to the mythological ladies. The original poster is correct, this is extreme "well, duh, no shit, Sherlock" territory. --Khajidha (talk) 17:41, 24 November 2018 (UTC) For westerners who are familiar with the Amazons already. Ian.thomson (talk) 17:51, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Submarine... new low... haha, yes I geddit. Lolness. Martinevans123 (talk) 17:52, 24 November 2018 (UTC) ┌─────────────────────────┘ Well, heck, dyk there was a whole bunch of stuff named after those mystical ladies, including a bunch of other boats! Paine Ellsworth, ed. put'r there 19:46, 24 November 2018 (UTC) I thought they were all named after Jeff Bezos' company. 2600:8800:1880:188:5604:A6FF:FE38:4B26 (talk) 22:19, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Grrr ... everyone else has already cracked all the good jokes I thought of. Daniel Case (talk) 22:48, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Leaving aside the sideline tribute to Airplane...and face it, guys, you’ll never top User:Martinevans123’s impression of Johnny, it’s bred in the bone...there’s an ongoing problem with this secrion of the main page. If the best argument someone can make is that a dead obvious DYK might enlighten someone totally unfamiliar with Western society, just rename it NSS and have done with it...and get it off the main page, because it doesnt really belong any more. Qwirkle (talk) 04:18, 25 November 2018 (UTC) So is it that we're not getting non-western readers, or is it that they don't count? Because I know the former is wrong and I'd rather say the latter is as well. Or if you're not operating from the imperialist assumption that western culture is the global standard and that anyone who doesn't know it as well as their own is some savage we can ignore, should we avoid any DYK that someone from any part of the planet might say "well no duh" to? Because on Nov 19, we had an entry that many Filipino readers would remember. Heck, even within western cultures, we have entries that specific cultures would say "well no duh" too -- on Nov 13, we had an entry a lot of people in Finland would remember. And where do we set the bar? On Nov 13, we said that Ptolemy founded the Ptolemaic dynasty, which I'd regard as pretty obvious history info. On Nov 1, we had an entry saying that Satyrs were spirits in Greek mythology, something equally as basic as the Amazons. That's just in this month. Maybe, instead of just looking for something to pretend to complain about to feel smugly superior for knowing one's own culture, one could consider that that culture is not universal, that English is the most common second language on the planet, and this site is consistently within the top 10 most popular websites around the globe. Ian.thomson (talk) 04:41, 25 November 2018 (UTC) If the best defense you can mount is a few adhominem strawmen, with a little PC flourishes thrown in, you should consider the possibility that your position is indefensible. Qwirkle (talk) 05:10, 25 November 2018 (UTC) You have yet to present a valid reason for your complaints, just arguments that only work on the assumption that western culture is universal or that we don't get non-western readers or that non-western readers don't count -- none of which are true. I've taught plenty of university students overseas who would not have known who the original Amazons were, and they weren't stupid, they knew plenty about their culture that you wouldn't. To say that non-westerners wouldn't know some facet of western culture isn't some hypothetical for the sake of political correctness, it's a fact that anyone aware of the world beyond their own home town knows. It's a "no shit Sherlock" for anyone mature enough to acknowledge other cultures. If the best offense you can mount is dismissing huge swaths of the planet as "political correctness," you should consider the possibility that your attitude doesn't belong on the project. Ian.thomson (talk) 15:58, 25 November 2018 (UTC) Ahh, shifting to the CIR defense...you were intending cultural outreach, but this was the best you could manage...while still piling on the virtue-signalling. The laddie doth protest too much, methinks. Qwirkle (talk) 21:11, 25 November 2018 (UTC) The discussion above is closed. Please do not modify it.
