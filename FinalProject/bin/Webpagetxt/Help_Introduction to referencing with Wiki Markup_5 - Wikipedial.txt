Summary Review of what you've learned Shortcut WP:INTREF5 Summary All article content must be verifiable, that is, to be possible to support with a reliable, published source. All quotations, any material whose verifiability has been challenged or is likely to be challenged, and contentious material, whether negative, positive, or neutral, about living persons, must include an inline citation. Inline citations are added between <ref>...</ref> tags, after the fact they support. A {{Reflist}} template should be added at the end of the article, in a "References" section, for the inline citations to display properly. The RefToolbar can be used to make adding citations easier, by clicking "Cite" in the toolbar at the top of the edit window. Wikipedia articles require citations to reliable, published sources, with a reputation for fact-checking and accuracy.
