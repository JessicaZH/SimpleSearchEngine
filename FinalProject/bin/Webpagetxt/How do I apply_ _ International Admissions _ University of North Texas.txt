Submit Your Passport Submit the pages from your most current passport that list your identification information, including the page with your picture on it. Copies can be scanned and emailed to international@unt.edu. PLEASE NOTE: Zip files and links to Google Docs will automatically move your email to a “Quarantined” state and the process of removing your email from quarantine will take 2-3 days, delaying your admissions processing. Please do not .zip your documents. The immigration office may request this document again for processing your I-20 through the iNorthTX portal. 6. Check Academic Department Requirements & Deadlines Acceptance to UNT does not guarantee acceptance into the major of your choice. Check with your academic department for other requirements and deadlines. Departmental applications, test scores, references, auditions, and other items may be required by a different deadline. Additional Information Attention students who require an I-20 to study at UNT: I20 requests can be submitted through the iNorthTX portal for students who have been admitted. Per federal regulation, UNT is not able to issue I-20s to international students until they have received full admission to UNT. Please check your MyUNT portal for more information on your admission status. Attention students currently attending a school in the United States on a F-1 visa who want to transfer to UNT: First, you must be admitted to a UNT program. After you are admitted to a UNT program, please contact your immigration advisor at your current school about transferring your immigration record to UNT. Attention undergraduate students applying to both IELI and UNT: Be aware that the College of Music will not evaluate an applicant’s file until the student passes the music audition and until they demonstrate English Language Proficiency (ELP). Qualified students applying for IELI and the College of Music will receive an IELI only admission letter and I-20 (if needed) for the above-mentioned program. After completing IELI, the student must apply to UNT, and the application’s acceptance depends on the student passing a College of Music audition and meeting other University requirements. For most other majors not listed above, a review for conditional admission is possible. Previous page Next page Top Main Menu Home Freshman Transfer International Graduate Why UNT?
