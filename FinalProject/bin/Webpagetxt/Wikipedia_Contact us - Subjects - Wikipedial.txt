Wikipedia:Contact us - Subjects - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Contact us - Subjects From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Introduction Readers How to report a problem with an article, or find out more information. Article subjects Problems with articles about you, your company, or somebody you represent. Licensing How to copy Wikipedia's information, donate your own, or report unlicensed use of your information. Donors Find out about the process, how to donate, and information about how your money is spent. Press and partnerships If you're a member of the press looking to contact Wikipedia, or have a business proposal for us. If you believe an article about you or your organization is incomplete, inaccurate, or biased, there are several avenues for you to discuss the issue with Wikipedia's editorial community. Location of the talk page tab Wikipedia does not have a centralised author or content reviewer, and our content is maintained by volunteer editors. The people who have edited or who monitor your article are probably the best first point of contact. People who edit or monitor your article can be reached by leaving a note detailing your issues on the article's "talk" page. This can be found by clicking the "talk" link at the top of your article. Once you're there, click the "new section" tab to the right of that. This will create a new section, where you can post your specific comments or concerns - put {{request edit}} at the top of your new section to indicate your conflict of interest and ask for the edits to be done for you. Click "Publish page", and your new section will be added immediately. If leaving a message on the talk page does not help, you can leave a message on the help page, which is more frequently monitored. Alternatively, you can reach other experienced volunteers by emailing info-en-qwikimedia.org . Please include the address or title of your article and specific information on the problems you have with it. While your email will likely remain confidential, certain unforeseen circumstances, including but not limited to security breaches, subpoenas, or leaks, might compromise that confidentiality. Note that while volunteers may assist you in removing very bad data, they will not add new data for you - for such edits you need to use the talk page as described above. If you're interested in donating photographs to illustrate your article or adding a recording of your voice, you can upload them yourself and include them in the article. Alternatively, you can email photosubmissionwikimedia.org . Please include the photograph in question, along with a statement that you own the copyright on it, and an agreement to release it under a free license. Our recommended license is the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. If you don't own the copyright, please ask the photographer or copyright owner to send in a release instead. The "declaration of consent" may be used if desired.
