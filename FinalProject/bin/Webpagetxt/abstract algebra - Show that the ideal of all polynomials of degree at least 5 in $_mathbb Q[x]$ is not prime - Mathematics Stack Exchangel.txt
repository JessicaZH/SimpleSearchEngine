I've proven that $I$ is an ideal (any polynomial multiplied by a polynomial in $I$ must be at least degree 5), but I'm unsure to how to prove that it is not a prime ideal. My intuition says that its not, because we can't use $(1)$ or $(x)$ as generators. I know that $I$ is a prime ideal $\iff$ $R/I$ is an integral domain. Again, I'm a little confused on how represent $\mathbb{Q}[x]/I$ abstract-algebra polynomials commutative-algebra ring-theory ideals share|cite|improve this question edited Oct 1 '13 at 16:19 azimut 16.1k1051100 asked Feb 10 '13 at 17:28 zzzzzzzzzzz 729421 4 From $I=(x^5)$ everything follows. – Martin Brandenburg Feb 10 '13 at 18:41 add a comment | 4 Answers 4 active oldest votes up vote 8 down vote accepted By definition, $I$ is a prime ideal if for all $f,g\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ with $fg\in I$ you have $f\in I$ or $g\in I$. So to show that $I$ is not prime, it suffices to give a single counterexample. Look at $f = x^2$ and $g = x^3$... share|cite|improve this answer answered Feb 10 '13 at 17:35 azimut 16.1k1051100 1 Thank you, this is clear and concise. I should review my definitions. – zzzzzzzzzzz Feb 10 '13 at 17:40 add a comment | up vote 4 down vote You need only find two polynomials $p,q\in\Bbb Q[x]$ such that $p,q\notin I$ and $p\cdot q\in I$. Think about monomials. share|cite|improve this answer answered Feb 10 '13 at 17:36 Cameron Buie 84.6k771155 add a comment | up vote 3 down vote Hint $\ $ For any prime ideal $\rm\,P\!:\,\ x^n\in P\:\Rightarrow\:x\in P.\:$ Thus $\rm\ x^5 \in I\,$ but $\rm\ x\not\in I\ \Rightarrow\ I\,$ is not prime. Equivalently, $\rm\, R\ mod\ P\,$ has a nilpotent ($\Rightarrow$ zero-divisor): $\rm\, x^5\equiv 0,\ x\not\equiv 0,\,$ so it is not a domain. Remark $\ $ Generally prime ideals can be generated by irreducible elements (in any domain where nonunits factor into irreducibles), since one can replace any reducible generator by some factor, then iterate till all generators are irreducible. In particular, in UFDs, where irreducibles are prime, prime ideals can be generated by prime elements. This property characterizes UFDs. Well-known is Kaplansky's case: a domain is a UFD iff every prime ideal $\!\ne\! 0$ contains a prime $\!\ne\! 0.$ share|cite|improve this answer edited Apr 13 '17 at 12:21 Community♦ 1 answered Feb 10 '13 at 18:47 Math Gems 16.8k11937 add a comment | up vote 2 down vote Denote by $[f]$ the residue class of $f$ in $\Bbb{Q}[x]/I$. Then $[x],[x^4] \neq 0$, because neither $x \in I$ nor $x^4 \in I$. But what can you say about the product $$ [x] \cdot [x^4] $$ Can you conclude that $I$ is not a prime ideal? share|cite|improve this answer answered Feb 10 '13 at 17:37 Nils Matthes 3,03421439 add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Mathematics Stack Exchange!
