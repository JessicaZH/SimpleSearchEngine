How early should you apply? Freshmen applicants may apply up to a year in advance of their expected term of enrollment; however, many high school students typically apply between July and December of their senior year. It's best to apply as early as possible so that you'll have more scholarships available, and more options for orientation dates and housing preferences. When are admission decisions made? Admission decisions are made on a rolling basis. You'll be informed of your admission status via a letter in the mail or your my.unt.edu account once we've received and processed your complete application and all required documents.

Most standardized test scores are reportable for 5 years following the year in which you tested. Any standardized test scores that fall within this time period must be reported by the appropriate testing service. If your scores are not reportable by the appropriate testing service, you have the following options: If you have your original test score report from the testing service or a copy of it with your full name printed on it, you may bring the document to the UNT Undergraduate Admissions office (Eagle Student Services Building, 3rd floor) for review. If the scores meet our approval, we will make a copy for our records and return your document to you. You may retake the standardized admission test and have the new scores sent to UNT. If you have been out of high school for at least 5 years and have earned fewer than 30 semester hours at a college or university, please see the information about our Adult Admission Program. Essays and letters of recommendation You will not need to mail letters of recommendation with your application unless additional information is requested of you by an admission officer and is necessary to evaluate your application for admission to the university. If letters of recommendation or an essay are required, you will receive a letter from an Admissions Counselor requesting those documents. At that time, you should submit your essay and ask the appropriate people to submit letters of recommendation directly to our office. Letters of recommendation should be submitted by your high school counselor and two teachers. Previous page Next page Top Main Menu Home Freshman Transfer International Graduate Why UNT?
