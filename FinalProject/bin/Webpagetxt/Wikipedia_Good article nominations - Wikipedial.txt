Wikipedia:Good article nominations - Wikipedia Wikipedia:Good article nominations From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Main Discussion Nominations Reassessment GA Cup Instructions Criteria Report Help Desk Shortcuts WP:GAN WP:GAC A good article nomination (GAN) is an article that is to be evaluated against the good article criteria in order to become a good article (GA). The standard of quality for good articles is less than that for featured articles. Here is the complete list of good article nominations: there are currently 516 nominations listed and 418 waiting to be reviewed. Anyone may nominate an article, and any uninvolved and registered user with sufficient knowledge and experience with Wikipedia content policies may review an article nominated at this page against the good article criteria. A responsive nominator and reviewer can complete a review in about seven days. Nominators should respond positively to constructive criticism and work with the reviewer to improve the article (if there are any issues) to good article status. If the article is promoted, a small plus sign inside a circle () will appear on the top right corner of the article's page indicating that the article has been deemed good by the reviewer. The instructions on the reviewing and nominating process can be found by clicking the "Instructions" tab above. If you need to nominate an article for delisting from good article status, please click the "Reassessment" tab above. ATTENTION NEW NOMINATORS AND REVIEWERS: PLEASE READ THE INSTRUCTIONS PAGE.
