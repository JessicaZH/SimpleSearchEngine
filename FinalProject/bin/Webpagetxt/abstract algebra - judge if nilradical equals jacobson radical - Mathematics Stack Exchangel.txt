I think 1)should be wrong but example like $\mathbf{Z}$ does not work... and 3) is a special case of 2), I mean if 3) is wrong then 2) is also wrong.. and for the rest, I have no idea.. abstract-algebra ring-theory commutative-algebra noetherian share|cite|improve this question edited Dec 21 '14 at 1:28 asked Dec 21 '14 at 1:22 annimal 511312 1 Is this your homework? It doesn't seem you are spending enough to time to think about it before asking. – Manos Dec 21 '14 at 1:29 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 0 down vote accepted (1) In a Noetherian ring nilradical can be equal to Jacobson radical, even if it is not a Artin ring. $\mathbb{Z}$ is an example. In fact any Jacobson ring has this property. (2) is not true, because in this case the nilradical is the zero ideal, but Jacobson radical is a non-zero ideal (since it is not a field). Take any Noetherian local domain which is a DVR. (3) is not true in general because of (2). (4) is not true in general again because of (2). share|cite|improve this answer edited Dec 21 '14 at 3:19 answered Dec 21 '14 at 1:52 Krish 6,29411020 yeah, it's true, but can you give me some concrete examples of (1) (2) (4) that the two radical are not equal? and for(3) is $k\times k$ a field? I think they may not be integral domain, like $(0,1)\times (1,0)$ is $(0,0)$ in $Z_2 \times Z_2$ – annimal Dec 21 '14 at 2:51 @annimal: Ah..!! Sorry. in (3) I missed the "integral domain" part. I'll edit my answer. and you are right $k \times k$ is not an integral domain. – Krish Dec 21 '14 at 3:01 add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Mathematics Stack Exchange!
