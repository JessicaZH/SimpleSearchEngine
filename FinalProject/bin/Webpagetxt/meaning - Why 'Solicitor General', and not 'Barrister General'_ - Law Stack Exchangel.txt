Ask Question up vote 3 down vote favorite In countries with this dichotomy of the legal profession, mostly barristers argue in courts. In the UK, solicitors with Higher Rights of Audience can argue in lower courts. However, if Solicitors General argue in courts, then ought they not be called 'Barristers General'? Does this nomenclature contradict the English definitions of 'barrister' vs 'solicitor'? meaning comparative-law legal-terms share|improve this question edited May 31 '15 at 14:00 feetwet♦ 14.3k93991 asked May 30 '15 at 2:44 Greek - Area 51 Proposal 949520 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 5 down vote accepted The dichotomy between solicitors and barristers in the UK isn't one based on verbal definitions in the English language. In other words, the fact that barristers argue and solicitors don't isn't something that's inherent to the words, it's just how British law decided to divide it. Since those countries with solicitor generals don't have this dichotomy, they generally don't have anything actually called a barrister, and there's no reason why the solicitor general couldn't be called that, since solicitor doesn't require that he not argue in court. share|improve this answer answered May 31 '15 at 10:14 Roy 566414 The UK does of course have an Attorney General, who is in court more often than the Solictor General. – Tim Lymington Apr 15 '17 at 12:55 add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Law Stack Exchange!
