Evaluation of Non-USA Transcripts International Admissions at the University of North Texas uses a variety of sources to determine equivalencies. It is important to note that the list of equivalencies on our website is not complete, but rather represents the most common credentials we receive from each country. Our information does not always coincide with private evaluation agencies. UNT evaluates credentials exclusively for their education placement at this institution.
