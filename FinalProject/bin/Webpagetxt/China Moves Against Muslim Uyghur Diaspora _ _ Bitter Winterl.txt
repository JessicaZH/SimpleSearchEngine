Bitter Winter has learned that huge sums are being poured into international fake news campaigns to present all Muslim Uyghur activists as terrorists, in an endeavor to persuade Western countries to reject their asylum applications. An article in Foreign Policy also reports that Muslim Uyghurs who live abroad are persuaded to return to China under the threat of retaliations against their families. Once returned, they are arrested and sent to re-education camps.
