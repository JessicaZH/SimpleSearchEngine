You can build apps, share and purchase them from GitHub Marketplace, or browse useful tools and services that integrate with GitHub in Works with GitHub. To learn how to list an app on GitHub Marketplace, see "Getting started with GitHub Marketplace." Note: We no longer support GitHub Services as of October 1, 2018, and GitHub Services will stop working on January 31, 2019. Please see the blog post for details. You can use the Replacing GitHub Services guide to help you update your services to webhooks. GitHub Apps are the officially recommended way to integrate with GitHub because they offer much more granular permissions to access data, but GitHub supports both OAuth Apps and GitHub Apps. For information on choosing a type of app, see "About apps" and "Differences between apps." For a walkthrough of the process of building a GitHub App, see "Building Your First GitHub App." Requesting support For questions, bug reports, and discussions about GitHub Apps, OAuth Apps, and API development, explore the GitHub API Development and Support Forum.
