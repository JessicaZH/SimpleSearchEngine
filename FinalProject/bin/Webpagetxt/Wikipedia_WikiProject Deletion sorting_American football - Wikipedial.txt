It is one of many deletion lists coordinated by WikiProject Deletion sorting. Anyone can help maintain the list on this page. Adding a new AfD discussion Adding an AfD to this page does not add it to the main page at WP:AFD. Similarly, removing an AfD from this page does not remove it from the main page at WP:AFD. If you want to nominate an article for deletion, go through the process on that page before adding it to this page. To add a discussion to this page, follow these steps: Edit this page and add {{Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName}} to the top of the list. Replace "PageName" with the relevant article name, i.e. the one on the existing AFD discussion. Also, indicate the title of the article in the edit summary, it is particularly helpful to add a link to the article in the edit summary. When you save the page, the discussion will automatically appear. You should also tag the AfD by adding {{subst:delsort|American football|~~~~}} to it, which will inform editors that it has been listed here. You may place this tag above or below the nomination statement or at the end of the discussion thread. Note that there are a few scripts and tools that can make this easier. Removing a closed AfD discussion Closed AfD discussions are automatically removed by a bot. Other types of discussions You can also add and remove links to other discussions (prod, CfD, TfD etc.) related to American football. Further information For further information see Wikipedia's deletion policy and WP:AfD for general information about Articles for Deletion, including a list of article deletions sorted by day of nomination. This list is also part of the larger list of deletion debates related to Sports.

Searches turned up a single hit, which is already in the stub. In fact, that source is sort of like an anti-notability claim, and has a single line about this coach, "In 1935, under the direction of Lucien Abraham, local high school coach and commander of Batesville's National Guard unit, the Panthers returned to their losing ways." In fact, the season was so bad, the football program was dropped after the season. Fails WP:GNG and utterly fails WP:NCOLLATH. Onel5969 TT me 17:36, 26 November 2018 (UTC) Keep Having a losing a record as a coach does not erode notability. Abraham later became a chief officer adjutant general of the Arkansas National Guard, as noted with additional source added to article prior to nomination here. Jweiss11 (talk) 18:14, 26 November 2018 (UTC) Comment - And therefore meets neither WP:NCOLLATH nor WP:NSOLDIER (the title is "general", but his rank was "colonel"). Onel5969 TT me 18:32, 26 November 2018 (UTC) He was later promoted to general. Jweiss11 (talk) 19:06, 26 November 2018 (UTC) One can also fail to meet WP:NCOLLATH and WP:NSOLDIER, but still pass WP:GNG. In other words, passing WP:NCOLLATH or WP:NSOLDIER can be sufficient to establish notability, but failing them does not necessarily disqualify the subject. Jweiss11 (talk) 19:09, 26 November 2018 (UTC) Absolutely. But he doesn't even come close to passing GNG, so his only shot was under the specialty guidelines.

CAPTAIN RAJU(T) 23:23, 26 November 2018 (UTC) Keep It's rare that a head football coach at a 4-year college would not be considered notable, and college athletic directors also tend to be considered notable. I'm not shocked that a head football coach from 1935 does not dominate in a "google news search" but it is nice to see several historical references in the sources. A poor win/loss record in sports can be just as notable is a great one, as seen with Ronald Beard. Sure, it's a stub article but stubs are okay and this one actually has enough information to pass WP:GNG--three of the sources point to that; two newspaper articles from the 1950's and a book from 2003. The "Find-A-Grave" website doesn't establish notability, but it does provide useful information to a stub article that has already passed the threshold.--Paul McDonald (talk) 03:25, 27 November 2018 (UTC) Query This has also been bugging me in the nomination: the nominator states that the re-direct was reverted under the claim that notability could be established "which then promptly was not" -- but when I look at the history of the article, I see that within less than an hour of that revert, an editor added two more sources to further establish notability before the nominator brought it to AFD. I have no problem with good faith nominations for AFD (even those I disagree with) but I have to point out that the phrase "which then promptly was not" because I don't know how something can be promptly not be done -- what is the meaning of that phrase in the nomination?--Paul McDonald (talk) 03:34, 27 November 2018 (UTC) Keep as a general officer per WP:SOLDIER. And yes, that does apply to reservists as well. -- Necrothesp (talk) 11:19, 27 November 2018 (UTC) Keep I am satisfied with the promotion to Major General which creates presume notability per SOLDIER. Coverage of the 30s-40s-50s-60s (particularly for figures significant on a state level) in digitized form on-line is at times more difficult than earlier periods. Icewhiz (talk) 16:38, 27 November 2018 (UTC) Keep, as he appears to meet the WP:SOLDIER requirements. Ejgreen77 (talk) 01:22, 28 November 2018 (UTC) Keep. Having attained the rank of major general, appears to pass WP:SOLDIER. Cbl62 (talk) 19:04, 28 November 2018 (UTC) Keep Meets WP:SOLDIER. I found another image of him [1] Hawkeye7 (discuss) 19:10, 29 November 2018 (UTC) Nice find! I've added it to the article. It needs some editing, I admit.--Paul McDonald (talk) 20:00, 29 November 2018 (UTC) Nicco Fertitta[edit] Nicco Fertitta (edit | talk | history | protect | delete | links | watch | logs | views) – (View AfD · Stats) (Find sources: Google (books · news · newspapers · scholar · free images · WP refs) · FENS · HighBeam · JSTOR · NYT · TWL) While he is a starting player on one of the top college football teams, he does not meet any of the four core criteria in WP:NCOLLATH beyond routine media coverage about signing with Notre Dame or game recaps. Notre Dame's biography of him does not indicate that he received any national awards, and his current season stats do not indicate an All-American in the making. The South Bend Tribune [2] and SB Nation's Notre Dame website [3] have done profiles of Fertitta, but neither meets the "national media attention" requirement in NCOLLATH. Also, just because he comes from the notable Fertitta business family (his father is Lorenzo Fertitta of Ultimate Fighting Championship fame) does not mean Nicco meets WP:BIO.

Bakazaka (talk) 21:59, 25 November 2018 (UTC) Keep Starting defensive players at top-tier schools like Notre Dame tend to generate enough press to pass WP:GNG and this one seems to have done so. Beyond the significant number of mentions in other news articles, there are two feature articles in Sports and Las Vegas Sun that show a clear pass of the general notability guideline. There is more than one path to notability.--Paul McDonald (talk) 13:34, 26 November 2018 (UTC) A corrected link to the NBC Sports story is here. While it is an example of national media coverage, it appears to be WP:ROUTINE because it was part of a series analyzing every player on the Notre Dame roster hence the title "Notre Dame 99-to-2". Arbor to SJ (talk) 03:56, 27 November 2018 (UTC) Feature articles are WP:NOTROUTINE by any stretch-- (far beyond the threshold of "sports scores". Further, WP:ROUTINE only applies to events and not people.--Paul McDonald (talk) 12:10, 27 November 2018 (UTC) Marquis Wright[edit] Marquis Wright (edit | talk | history | protect | delete | links | watch | logs | views) – (View AfD · Stats) (Find sources: Google (books · news · newspapers · scholar · free images · WP refs) · FENS · HighBeam · JSTOR · NYT · TWL) Restored following PROD at the subject's request, but there's no evidence he passes the notability requirements for college football athletes nor does his subsequent career establish general notability.

Article created by a single purpose editor. The sources in the article are either not "independent" or do not constitute "significant" coverage. Fails under WP:GNG, WP:NGRIDIRON, and WP:NCOLLATH. Cbl62 (talk) 05:41, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Delete As the article is written, it seems to be somewhat promotional in nature and the sources don't seem to be providing any notability or significant coverage--just basic statistics, which widely are considered to not be enough to pass the threshold of notability standards. I also see the subject as failing WP:GNG, WP:NGRIDIRON, and WP:NCOLLATH .--Paul McDonald (talk) 14:24, 24 November 2018 (UTC) Delete I agree with the previous comments. I don't see that he meets WP:GNG, WP:NGRIDIRON, or WP:NCOLLATH. Papaursa (talk) 21:37, 25 November 2018 (UTC) DeleteI PRODed this page months ago because the subject is clearly not notable. The deletion was literally protested by the subject himself in order to have the page about him un-deleted.
