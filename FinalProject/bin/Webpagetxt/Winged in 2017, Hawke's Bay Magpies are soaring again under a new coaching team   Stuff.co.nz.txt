Mark Ozich never set out to coach a rugby team, but when he injured his spine, he had to figure out a way to be involved in the game he loved. Coaching seemed a natural progression for someone who as a kid would analyse athletes' performance. This season he became head coach of the Hawke's Bay Magpies. His side made the semifinals, getting knocked out by Otago in the final minute. Ozich thinks there's a massive future ahead. "You bunch of useless bastards," rings out from the stands. The cool spring air whips around the crowd at Napier's McLean Park on a Wednesday night. This is their province, their team, and these fans are going to let their feelings be known. The Magpies are down 14 points against Northland. Coach Mark Ozich, and his assistant, Josh Syms, walk through the stands at half time to get to the changing rooms, with jeers being hurled in their direction. DIANNE MANSON/GETTY Mark Ozich, head coach of Hawke's Bay, reckons his team has yet to play its best rugby.

I just try and stay focused on what [the team] has to do," Ozich later says. Ozich keeps his poise, and puts himself in their shoes. "It's been a rough couple of years for the fans, so I get it. They are holding us accountable." Hawkes Bay fans became accustomed to being the darling of the Championship competition, the second tier grade of the national rugby competition - currently known as the Mitre 10 Cup. Since the championship-premiership divide in 2011, the Magpies have stellar performances as a championship team: appearing in four finals, winning twice and, and always making it to the semifinals . That was until 2017, when they won only two games, and were second to last on the points table. The province and fans didn't like it. With a revamped player schedule and a new head coach, 2018 was the year the team had to prove itself to its fans. It was Ozich's job to lead the charge, or risk stalling his coaching career. Back in the locker room at the Northland game, it was crunch time. Ozich dished out a dose of self-belief. The players needed to know their coach knew they could do it. "There's no screaming, there's no yelling," Ozich explains. "We come up with a simple plan." The team turned the game around, thundering to a 14-point win. They also turned the crowd around, to cheer and chant. "Come on the bay. Black, white, alright. Come on the Bay." All's forgiven. "Our Hawke's Bay crowd is very passionate, we have a really good following and we are accountable to them," Ozich says. "We can't control what they say or do. What we are in control of is how we respond to that." More from Audrey Malone • Sundays news director audrey.malone@stuff.co.nz Ozich didn't always dream of being a coach. He was always interested in athletic performance, and loved watching Michael Jordan and figuring out "what differentiated him between the other players". So in hindsight, coaching was a natural progression, and getting the best out of people. He played for Counties-Manakau, was semi-professional in Scotland while plying his trade as a teacher. But as fate would have it, he had a major spinal injury, resulting in a spinal fusion. That ruled him out of playing the game he loved, so he figured he would start coaching. And since then, Ozich has been weaving his teaching career and his coaching career - inter-twining skills from both to achieve results. Ozich counts himself lucky to have Syms alongside him, who is also a teacher. They think a team should be run the same way, with two basic pillars for building success: people and skills. "It's all about how you treat people, you know, building relationships with the players, staff, with the community. And then making sure you keep working on skills. DIANNE MANSON/GETTY Hawke's Bay co-captain Brad Weber (left) credits Mark Ozich as the catalyst for the change in performance. "You need to keep dialogue open. We need it to be open, because we know we aren't going to get it right all the time." It's important to remember that good people lead to good rugby players, Ozich says. He has a holistic approach. "I think rugby is like any workplace, people are fighting their own battles, whether it is relationships, or money, or whatever. What we can do is provide a supportive environment for them to come into." That's why the leadership group is a diverse group, Super Rugby players, club rugby, Maori and Pasifika players. So that ensures that everyone has someone in the leadership group they feel comfortable leaning on. "We want that group to be a diverse group of players because everyone has a voice to talk to somebody and positively influence them. They all mix with different people, and they all have an opportunity to have a say. "We are trying to create an environment of honesty, accountability, and trust of each other." Ozich is set on being with the Magpies for the long term "My priority is to do the best job I can. I'm not focused on what else I could do. I have a lot to learn." "If I make them better people, they will be better players." Brad Weber, who stepped into the co-captain role alongside Gareth Evans after Ash Dixon's season was cut short due to injury, reckons Ozich was the catalyst for the change in the team. "He really cares about us, not just as players but as people. I want to play well for him," Weber says. KERRY MARSHALL/GETTY Hawke's Bay head coach Mark Ozich backs the region's passionate fans. He credits Ozich's philosophy of developing strong relationships within the team. Under Ozich's watch, the team has spent a lot of time together developing its own values and figuring out what it wanted to achieve. There have been group sessions, weekends spent together and BBQs - for which Weber provided cauliflower and broccoli salads, Dixon brought crayfish he had caught, and deer-hunting prop Ben May hauling in some venison. Halfback Weber found the 2017 Hawke's Bay season challenging: he was coming off a broken thigh bone which had ruled him out of the Super Rugby season with the Chiefs and wasn't as physically fit as he was used to. His game wasn't as sharp as it had been, and at times he would struggle with the team not performing very well. Weber finally found mental solace with his frustrations near the end of the season when Dr Paul Wood came and spoke to the team. Wood had turned his life around, after spending time in prison for killing his drug dealer. It sparked a glimmer of hope in Weber's grey matter, and he wanted to be with the team as it turned itself around, instead of seeing what other options he had. Weber believes his decisions paid off - 2018 was a great year. He was proud of how the team played and how they kept their heads up. Furthermore, the New Zealand Maori is already planning ahead to the 2019 season, and where the team can go. "I'm very proud. We could have won more games, but our attitude has been outstanding most of the time when we play." Ozich, like Weber, thinks the young team has a bright future in the coming years. "I still don't think we have played our best rugby yet." PETER LAMPP Magpies were the darlings of the championship competition. And then 2017 happened.
