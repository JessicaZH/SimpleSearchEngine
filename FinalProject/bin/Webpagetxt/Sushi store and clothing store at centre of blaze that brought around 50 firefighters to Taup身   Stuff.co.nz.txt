Fire Service Lakes District assistant area manager Hamish Smith, who had been on site through the night, said at 6am that the fire was now contained. It appeared the fire had been contained to two of the three shops, causing extensive damage to a food outlet and retail store. Robert Steven/STUFF The roof of Hamills Taupō collapsed during the town centre fire, making investigations difficult. Smith said the cause would take at least two days to investigate. "To get into the shops, we will need to bring heavy lifting equipment in to lift the rooves," he said. The fire started in either the sushi store, a Ridgeline clothing store, or in circuitry between the stores, he said.
