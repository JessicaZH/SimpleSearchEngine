I know they moved from the goal line to the back of the endzone for example, but have no idea when or why. Rethcir 18:37, Aug 7, 2004 (UTC) OK, but not for this article. The goals were moved in the NCAA from the goal line to the end line approximately 1920 IIRC, for the sake of safety -- removing the obstruction. Offset goal structures had been tried but deemed unsatisfactory. The remarks can be found in Spalding's Football Guide for the year it was done. The NFL, which had inherited NCAA rules, moved the goals back to the goal line approximately 1935, to make scoring goals easier, and all of pro football followed suit. In 1974, copying the WFL, the NFL moved the goals back to the end line, to make scoring goals harder. The National Federation of State High School Ass'ns inherited NCAA rules after the goals had been moved, so never had them on the goal lines. Canadian football always had the goals on the goal lines. -- robgood@bestweb.net When the goal posts were actually set into the ground on the goal line, the defense could effectively use the posts as extra blockers on a goal-line stand. There was also a famous incident when Sammy Baugh passed from deep in his end zone in a title game, and hit the post, resulting in a safety. But, whatever the safety concern, the NFL moved 'em back because they felt there were too many field goals and not enough touchdown attempts. WHPratt (talk) 04:10, 19 March 2009 (UTC) For some time, prior to the NFL moving the posts to the end line, the uprights themselves were actually set back about a yard from the goal line, with asn arrangement to hold the crossbar and upright above the crossbar out over the goal line. I am not sure when this practice started, but by the 1960s it was universal in both the NFL and AFL and continued until the post were moved back. 69.29.207.109 (talk) 12:36, 1 November 2009 (UTC) Actually, the crossbar is still offset, even with the single-support goal, with the post planted some distance beyond the end line. I've never seen an end-line goalpost without an offset. WHPratt (talk) 15:58, 22 December 2012 (UTC) Dropped Goal[edit] The official term (http://www.irb.com/NR/rdonlyres/939C2F53-6396-437D-9F29-74FA834504BC/0/9methodsofscoring.pdf) for a field goal in rugby union is "dropped goal" and I have edited the article accordingly. Field Goal Lore[edit] Is this section necessary? If it is, at least its first two subsections need a better title. ςפקιДИτς ☺ ☻ 05:24, 21 December 2005 (UTC) I agree it needs a better name but I think both are interesting bits of history about the subject. The fact the record was broken three times in one day and understanding that things go farther at higher altitudes are worth having in my opinion. Maybe I didn't write or express it well enough so feel free to edit. But a better title would be good. jager 15:55, 21 December 2005 (UTC) Style[edit] While the facts all check, the article, simply put, is poorly written. I saw quite a few run-ons, and overall it's just difficult to read. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.96.209.192 (talk • contribs) Thank you for your suggestion!

I have found no such proof of this rule change anywhere on the web. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 216.163.13.226 (talk) 18:46, 26 May 2008 (UTC) That makes no sense at all. There is no rule that states how far back the kicker must stand. Seven yards seems to be the minimum setback to get the kick away, but certainly that evolved from practice. WHPratt (talk) 04:06, 19 March 2009 (UTC) "Famous Field Goals" and "Infamous Field Goal Attempts" sections[edit] The "Famous Field Goals" and "Infamous Field Goal Attempts" sections suffer the same problem as NFL lore#Honorable Mentions: what criteria is being used, based on verified cited sources, to warrant inclusion of these events? Zzyzx11 (Talk) 06:12, 24 October 2006 (UTC) Agreed. The "Infamous" section is particularly unimpressive. Interesting in a trivia sense only. These anecdotes should be limited to events that: Changed the outcome (as in winner, not just the final score) of a significant game. By significant, I would say a championship (e.g., the AFC/NFC conference championships, or Superbowl) or a playoff where the benefitting team went on to win a championship . If the benefitting team lost the next playoff game, who really cares except the fans of the losing team? Shed light on the peculiarities of the game. Returning a missed kick for a score is an example, though that one is used earlier in the article. Using these criteria, I would submit that the two anecdotes appearing in the "Infamous" section now would be excluded. Several others in the article would also be removed. Carboncopy 16:48, 13 November 2006 (UTC) I cleaned up some junk from that section. The one about the Chicago Bears defeating the Broncos last year was nonsense. I mean how is it a historic kick when it helped one sub .500 team win over another sub .500? LoyalSoldier (talk) 04:17, 30 May 2008 (UTC) Cleaned up some junk as well -- Used criteria above, but added record kicks and one record attempt (a 76-yard attempt seemed noteworthy).Johnelwayrules (talk) 12:27, 13 October 2008 (UTC) I would argue that Doug Flutie's drop kick field goal for the Patriots in 2008 should be included in famous field goals, since no such attempt had been successful in the NFL since 1941 (and even before 1941 very few were attempted.) In college football, the last known successful drop kick field goal occurred in 1990 and could also be included. In college, there also had not been any successful drop kick field goals since before 1940. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 140.142.113.145 (talk) 21:43, 25 November 2009 (UTC) The Atlanta Falcons had a kicker named Mick Luckhurst, a former soccer player. I recall him attempting some drop kick field goals and extra points in pre-season exhibition games one year. Someone may want to research that for possible inclusion. WHPratt (talk) 16:18, 11 March 2010 (UTC) proof of J.P Ross' kick?[edit] 65 yard field goal.. drop kick? seems impossible. is there any other proof of this? In 1892? Who knows what the field conditions, or the wind situation, or the goal posts were under the standards of that age. The ball was probably a lot rounder than it is now, and that could have helped. WHPratt (talk) 16:10, 5 November 2010 (UTC) Split[edit] I'd like to propose that this page be split into three others (Field goal (rugby), Field goal (gridiron football), and Field goal (basketball)), with this page turned into a disambig. Any objections or comments? hateless 22:03, 6 December 2006 (UTC) I got bold and did it. I'll also copy this talk page to Talk:Field goal (gridiron football), since the discussion here is exclusively to the north american variety. hateless 03:59, 11 December 2006 (UTC) The name of this page[edit] I agree with the split, but I disagree with the name, since "gridiron football" is not a term generally used in North America. Since the term "field goal" is not used in association football (soccer), I think it would be unambiguous to title the page "Field goal (football)." We could also say "Field goal (American and Canadian football)". -- Mwalcoff 00:00, 12 December 2006 (UTC) I'll concur. I admit I haven't given much thought over the name, since my knowledge of football/soccer is slim. Seems other pages use "football" as a disambiguator instead of "American and Canadian football" so I think that's finehateless 22:48, 15 December 2006 (UTC) College Football Attempts?[edit] I know this doesn't seem important, but in a 2006 game between Clemson and Wake Forest, Wake Forest was preparing to kick a field goal against the wind with the clock running at the end of the 3rd quarter, about to take a 20-3 lead. Instead, they elected to wait until the start of the 4th and kick into the wind, but a botched snap picked up by Wake Forest quarterback Riley Skinner allowed Clemson defensive end Gaines Adams to knock the ball out of Skinner's hands and run it down the field to spark what became a 24-point comeback. The final score was Clemson 27, Wake Forest 17. It was nominated for ESPN's "Game Changing Performance" play. Zchris87v 00:38, 17 January 2007 (UTC) Drop Kicks[edit] While mentioned a few times in the article there is no explanation about the drop-kick field goal rules or if they are even still in the rulebook. (Which is why I came to the page to look for). If there is someone knowledgable about the topic this seems to me to be something that should be included. Or at least a link to another page about them.Dcpirahna 19:38, 3 May 2007 (UTC) Missing from strategy section: faked/botched attempts[edit] Shouldn't there be something in the strategy section about faked and botched field goals (e.g. lining up as if to kick a fg, but instead, playing for the first down or goal)? I'm not really enough of an expert to do it myself... --Register allocation 17:08, 23 August 2007 (UTC) Plus ten for my tiny heiny[edit] From http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/1231 The distance of a field goal is the exact amount of yards from where the ball is kicked to where the crossbar is on the goalpost. Most often, the distance is 17 yards more than the yardline where the ball is snapped from because the end zone is 10 yards, and most kickers kick the ball from 7 yards behind the line of scrimmage. This article would benefit from an explanation of the measurement rules for all the leagues covered. MaxEnt 04:59, 15 October 2007 (UTC) Is the 7 yard drop fixed in the rules (NFL)? ie. if someone was after the record could they place it further back, or is the measure scrimmage + 17 regardless? The "most often" verbiage indicates there is this flexibility. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 108.87.16.133 (talk) 02:30, 17 August 2012 (UTC) Removing "how to" section in "How field goals are kicked"[edit] I've taken the liberty of being bold and removing three paragraphs that read like a how-to manual, which is not what Wikipedia is trying to be. If anyone can refactor the content into something more encyclopedic, please feel free to do so. RJaguar3 | u | t 00:10, 30 May 2008 (UTC) is the crossbar 10 or 15 feet?[edit] this page gives the crossbar height as 15 feet in the opening section, but then later says the crossbar (in the NFL, CFL and NCAA) is "10 feet (3.0 meters)." i'm assuming the "15 feet" part is a typo. Missed and blocked field goals[edit] In the NFL, missed field goals attempted from the 40-yard line or closer result in the opposing team taking possession at the 20-yard line. Missed field goals attempted from beyond the 20-yard line result in the opposing team taking possession at the spot of the kick. Until 1994, the opposing team would take position at the line of scrimmage, unless the kick was made from inside the 20. If a field goal is "attempted from the 40 yard line or closer" it would also encompass a significant number "attempted from beyond the 20-yardline." Clarification is a must. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 75.6.136.225 (talk) 03:56, 3 November 2008 (UTC) Quote: ". . . Until 1994, the opposing team would take position at the line of scrimmage, unless the kick was attempted from inside the 20-yard line." Immediately followed by ... Quote: "Prior to the 1974 season, missed field goals resulted in the opposing team gaining possession at the line of scrimmage or the 20-yard line, whichever was closer to the goalpost." The second sentence says pretty much the same thing as the first. It should state that, prior to 1974, a missed field goal was treated the same as a punt: it had to be returned, unless it went out of bounds or resulted in a touchback." WHPratt (talk) 04:01, 19 March 2009 (UTC) Quote: "September 28, 2008: Sebastian Janikowski of the Oakland Raiders attempted a 76 yard field goal. It fell short." I've never seen a list of the longest misses -- maybe someone can produce it. I recall Mark Mosely trying one from maybe 73 yards once. It would be a funny statistic, because every one of us is capable of missing from 99 yards. However, you'd have to be pretty good to get the chance to try a very long one. WHPratt (talk) 04:18, 19 March 2009 (UTC) High School Records[edit] It says the record for High School is 84.5 yards. This doesn't seem remotely possible. Especially since the longest for pros and college is no longer than 70. I think it's a typo. And now there's one that says the longest high school field goal is 92 yard. I think it's more than a typo. I think its a hoax. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 72.198.222.145 (talk) 22:41, 11 December 2008 (UTC) No, it's a complete hoax. Canton played Franklin on October 2, 2009, all right, but lost the game 14-21. Five touchdowns were scored in the game. There were no field goals. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 96.28.228.202 (talk) 08:56, 8 October 2009 (UTC) Most of those are rubbish. Googling any of the reference-less entries there only brings up references to this Wikipedia list, here and on other sites. That would, however leave just three entries, making for a very short 'list'. ReelExterminator (talk) 21:57, 15 November 2009 (UTC) Went ahead and deleted the unsourced records ReelExterminator (talk) 22:05, 15 November 2009 (UTC) page should be Field goal (American football)[edit] football could imply soccer, American football would be distinct.--Levineps (talk) 01:12, 2 September 2009 (UTC) Why? I was unaware there was a field goal in soccer. That should probably be mentioned on this article. On the other hand, if there is no field goal in soccer, then no further dismbiguation is necessary anyway. DoubleBlue (talk) 01:46, 2 September 2009 (UTC) Rugby league and rugby union are codes of football that have field goals. Some disambiguation would be preferable, in my opinion. I note this page was previously at Field goal (gridiron football). LunarLander // talk // 18:52, 1 February 2010 (UTC) NFL, Field-goal Records-Clarification[edit] Someone had entered the NFL record as 72 yards, kicked by Tom Oling of the Chicago Cardinals in 1970. I changed it back to Tom Dempsey with the correcy distance of 63 yards. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 216.158.175.136 (talk) 23:14, 1 August 2010 (UTC) 62 - Rob Bironas' kick on Dec 03, 2006 should be 60 yards: Game Log: http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2006120308/2006/REG13/colts@titans Game Log: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612030oti.htm Mention: http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261203010 Score was 20 - 17 60 - Morten Anderson, Oct 27, 1991 Game Log: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199110270nor.htm Mention: http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261022027 Score was 17 - 20 60 - Steve Cox, Oct. 21, 1984 Game Log: http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198410210cin.htm Mention: http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=261022027 Score was 9 - 12 —Preceding unsigned comment added by Logicallyimmortal (talk • contribs) 05:15, 30 November 2009 (UTC) 59 - Tony Franklin, 1979 - This kick, vs. Dallas is montioned on the Tony Franklin Wiki page but not listed on the NFL records page. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.0.113.106 (talk) 20:06, 27 December 2009 (UTC) As someone might look here for "Shortest Field Goal," the article might mention that this statistic is essentially trivial. Over the period 1932-1973, whenever an NFL team settled for a field goal despite the line of scrimmage being only inches from the goal line, a seven-yard FG would result, as the ball would be snapped from just outside the goal line. (That is, unless there is verifiable evidence that someone converted a shorter one via a shorter snap or maybe a drop kick.) Under the college rules and the present NFL rules, this same kick is a 17-yard FG given the distance to the end line. (I would suspect that most kickers and their holders would set up exactly as they do for an extra point for the sake of familiarity rather than trying to exploit the slightly shorter distance.) The CFL record book used to list a specific 8-yarder as the shortest FG, which makes sense, as the line of scrimmage would never be closer than the one-yard line due to that league's rules. However, one would guess that this happens fairly frequently. WHPratt (talk) 13:19, 2 September 2011 (UTC) XP/XPM/XPA[edit] I see these abbrevs in stats of footballers, eg., Ryan Succop.

Does anybody know what game he kicked the 62 yarder? It's not on the "Longest in the NFL list" —Preceding unsigned comment added by 192.91.173.42 (talk) 19:46, 18 October 2010 (UTC) UPDATE SEBASTIAN NOAW — Preceding unsigned comment added by 173.26.206.157 (talk) 04:06, 13 September 2011 (UTC) The Rule[edit] I seem to remember reading once that the actual text of the rule (NFL anyway) is slightly more complicated than just having the ball clear the crossbar and pass inside the uprights. It also had to touch something behind the goal line, or something like that. Strange, but I guess that could come into play if a kick got blown back after going through. Anybody have the exact wording? WHPratt (talk) 01:21, 13 October 2011 (UTC) Actually, if there were such a rule, it probably would have been deleted onced the goal posts were relegated to the end line. Onbiously, any kick that clears the crossbar between the posts is instantly out of play even as it scores the points. However, I believe that when the goal posts were located on the goal line, there was some additional language requiring the ball to touch down or pass out of play or some such. It's just a curiosity, but we're supposed to be encyclopedic here. WHPratt (talk) 05:15, 16 October 2011 (UTC) What happens after a successful field goal?[edit] Resolved: Article updated for kickoff after made FG—Bagumba (talk) 23:56, 6 February 2012 (UTC) Being a know-nothing European, I tried to find out what happens after a field goal is scored, in order to understand the odd (for me) strategy decisions both teams took during that last touchdown at last night's Super Bowl. I understand that the Giants scoring a field goal in that situation would've somehow been worse for the Patriots, and because of this the Patriots did allow the touch down to happen while the Giants seemingly tried not to score and rather to attempt a short-distance field goal at the next down. Presumably this was because what happens after a field goal is somehow something other than a kick-off by the scoring team from their own 35 yard line (do I get that right?) as it is in case of a touchdown. You might want to expand the article to answer that question... -- 77.21.99.8 (talk) 23:22, 6 February 2012 (UTC) There is a kickoff after a successful field goal, same as a touchdown. Commentators might have been referring to strategy of scoring slower to not leave any time left for the opponent, unrelated to what takes place after a FG or TD.—Bagumba (talk) 23:56, 6 February 2012 (UTC) Records/Measurement[edit] From where are field goal distances (and hence records) measured, from the line of scrimmage or from the point from which the ball is actually kicked? That information is strangley illusive. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 79.250.112.205 (talk) 12:44, 10 September 2012 (UTC) "Longest field goal records > NFL" in the index links to "Missed field goals > NFL" section[edit] I suspect this is a broader issue within Wikipedia when section titles are reused (both divs have an id of NFL). 76.28.196.44 (talk) 03:11, 29 October 2013 (UTC) "Longest Field Goal Records > Grammar, sentence structure.[edit] I realize this just happened today, so it probably hasn't gone through many edits or been reviewed, but can someone please reword/rewrite the following lines: "The longest field goal attempt ever in an NFL game was 70 yards by Ali Haji Shiek of the Giants in a 1983 game.

Gridiron football is a more WP:CONCISE and, despite the protests that it's an uncommon term, the term is commonly used on Wikipedia. Besides the article of the same name, it's used as a disambiguator in related articles, such as Goal line (gridiron football) and Conversion (gridiron football). --Relisted.

ErikHaugen (talk | contribs) 20:10, 24 January 2015 (UTC) Move to Field goal per @ErikHaugen:. It looks like the primary topic to me. @BDD:, @Red Slash:, and @CookieMonster755:, do you have any opinion on this idea? — Amakuru (talk) 17:20, 25 January 2015 (UTC) No objection. It's certainly the first thing I think of when I hear "field goal", and I remember being puzzled when I first heard the term used in basketball. I was a kid then, though, so I'm not saying I just heard of it or anything. The first page of results for "field goal" -wikipedia is all American football; the top two results on page two are basketball, but the rest of that page is American football too. And despite the general language at Goal (sport), it really only seems to be gridiron football and basketball that use the term. --BDD (talk) 17:25, 25 January 2015 (UTC) Yes, there is an exactly analogous concept in rugby football, but it's called a drop goal there, never a field goal. And association football (soccer) has goals, but they are not called field goals. — Amakuru (talk) 17:49, 25 January 2015 (UTC) It's field goal in Australian rugby league, which is part of the drop goal article, as union types will only have it as drop goal. But they're fairly rare and don't need their own page/redirect of whatever. Support field goal. Let me notify Talk:field goal Red Slash 23:45, 26 January 2015 (UTC) Why does that talk page even exist? It got out of sync with a corresponding article page? Dicklyon (talk) 16:32, 27 January 2015 (UTC) I would support Field goal if the proposal is amended to advertise it as such. Dicklyon (talk) 05:41, 27 January 2015 (UTC) Dick, didn't you object fairly strongly to amending an RM in the recent cases of the Washington Metro stations? Alternative proposals are carried without the initial nomination being modified all the time. --BDD (talk) 15:19, 27 January 2015 (UTC) I objected to that one (see Wikipedia:Move_review#Greenbelt_Station) and also the primary-topic move at Mustang, because the alternatives were never advertised at WP:RM and the close didn't seem to recognize that the midstream change controverted the adverstised intent. If we're going to change where Field goal takes people, we should not do that without listing the intent at WP:RM first, so people who might have an interest in objecting will have a chance to know it's going on.. That's what I meant by amending the proposal; the bot will propagate the change. It might be even better to just make a new RM, if that's what you're suggesting. Dicklyon (talk) 16:22, 27 January 2015 (UTC) I also support Field goal per the suggestion by ErikHaugen. Egsan Bacon (talk) 02:05, 28 January 2015 (UTC) Comment – at this point in the conversation I modified the proposal so the currently supported intention will be copied by the bot to the listing at WP:RM.

HandsomeFella (talk) 19:03, 30 January 2015 (UTC) Support – in addition to the arguments above, I don't think it can be seriously argued that this isn't the PRIMARYTOPIC as well, so article should go to Field goal. --IJBall (talk) 06:57, 31 January 2015 (UTC) Support, maybe with a top-link to the rugby term.
