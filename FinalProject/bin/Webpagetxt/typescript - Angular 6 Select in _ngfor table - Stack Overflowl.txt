Home Public Stack Overflow Tags Users Jobs Teams+Slack Q&A for work Learn More Angular 6 Select in *ngfor table Ask Question up vote 0 down vote favorite I have an Angular 6 component that fetches an observable list of users and then displays a table of the users using the *ngFor statement. Each row I have included a submit button that calls a function in the component ts file passing in the user for that row. This is working as expected so far. Now I want to add a select option to each row with a list of actions the user wants to perform. How do I get the value of the selected action for the correct row? Here is what I have so far. -Sample JSON object returned from http call. [
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "username": "user1",
    "firstName": "f1",
    "lastName": "l1",
    "active": true
  },
  {
    "userId": 2,
    "username": "user2",
    "firstName": "f2",
    "lastName": "l2",
    "active": true
  }
]
 In the component.ts I subscribe a property of type UserSearchModel[] to the json response and also created a function for the table to call. users$: UserSearchModel[];

submituseraction(user: UserSearchModel) {
    console.log(user.userId);
  }
 Here is the model. export class UserSearchModel {
    userId: number;
    username: string;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    active: boolean;   
}
 In the html I have the following tr for displaying and submitting the data.   <tr *ngFor="let user of users$">
    <td>{{ user.username}}</td>
    <td style="word-break: break-all">{{ user.firstName }}</td>
    <td style="word-break: break-all">{{ user.lastName }}</td>
    <td>{{ user.active }}</td>
    <td class="text-nowrap">
      <select name="usersearchactions" id="usersearchactions" title="Actions">
        <option value="0">Update User Info</option>
        <option value="1">Update Email</option>
        <option value="2">Reset Password</option>
        <option value="3">Notification Settings</option>
        <option value="11">Research</option>
      </select>
      <button (click)="submituseraction(user)" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" type="submit">GO!</button>
    </td>
  </tr>
 So far everything is great. I pull the list of users and properly display them. Each row will also have a drop down to select the action to perform on the user. I also get the correct user in my submituseraction method. The only problem I have is how do I get the selected action for that user in my submituseraction method? I was hoping there was an easy way to get that value without much change. I did try to update the UserSearchModel to include a new UserAction[] that is populated with my list and display it with the *ngfor command so that I can just grab that off the user object passed to the function. This does not work as the UserAction[] is undefined after populating the data in the subscribe event. I even tried to make it readonly and populate in the constructor with no luck. Both ways I end up with an undefined UserAction[] so now there isn't any actions populated in the select.     export class UserSearchModel {
        userId: number;
        username: string;
        firstName: string;
        lastName: string;
        active: boolean;
        userActions: UserAction[] = [
                { id: 0, name: "Update User Info" },
                { id: 1, name: "Update Email" },
                { id: 2, name: "Reset Password" },
                { id: 3, name: "Notification Settings" },
                { id: 4, name: "Patient Access Requests" },
                { id: 11, name: "Research" }
            ]
    }


    export class UserAction {
        id: number;
        name: string;
    }

<select name="userActions" id="userActions" title="Actions">
    <option *ngFor="let action of user.userActions" [value]="action"> 
        {{action.name}}</option>
      </select>
 I wasn't a big fan of changing the model but even this didn't work. Any help/direction/guidance would be much appreciated. Also, I am just starting out in Angular (probably obvious by the question) but if you see anything else that is obviously wrong with this please let me know. Thanks. angular typescript ngfor share|improve this question asked Jul 12 at 18:48 user1041169 86210 I failed finding the observable. Where do you use it? The $ in the end of the variable name indicates that object is an observable, but you defined it as an array of objects – Cristian Traìna Jul 12 at 18:56 I left out the code subscribing to a service to keep it focused. I only included that it was an observable in case that mattered in the solution. – user1041169 Jul 12 at 19:27 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 2 down vote accepted Add an angular variable declaration (#foo) to the select tag and pass in its value to submituseraction along with user. <select #actions name="usersearchactions" id="usersearchactions" title="Actions">
  <option value="0">Update User Info</option>
  <option value="1">Update Email</option>
  <option value="2">Reset Password</option>
  <option value="3">Notification Settings</option>
  <option value="11">Research</option>
</select>
<button (click)="submituseraction(user, actions.value)" class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" type="submit">GO!</button>
