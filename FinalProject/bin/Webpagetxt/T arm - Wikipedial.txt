T arm - Wikipedia T arm From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Transfer RNA The T-arm or T-loop is a specialized region on the tRNA molecule which acts as a special recognition site for the ribosome to form a tRNA-ribosome complex during protein biosynthesis or translation (biology). The T-arm has two components to it; the T-stems and the T-loop. There are two T-stems of five base pairs each. T-stem 1 is from 49-53 and T-stem 2 is from 61-65. The T-loop is also often known as the TΨC arm due to the presence of thymidine, pseudouridine and cytidine residues. Organisms with T-loop lacking tRNA exhibit a much lower level of aminoacylation and EF-Tu-binding than in organisms which have the native tRNA. In Mammalian DNA, telomeric repeat-binding factor 2 or TRF2 has been found to remodel linear telomeric DNA into large T-loops. References[edit] Griffith JD, Comeau L, Rosenfield S, et al. (May 1999).
