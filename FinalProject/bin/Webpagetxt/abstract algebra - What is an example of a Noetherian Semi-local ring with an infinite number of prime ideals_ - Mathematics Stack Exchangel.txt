Ask Question up vote 3 down vote favorite This question comes from the naive belief that $|Spec(R)|\subset P(|Specm(R)|)$, which I now know is only true if $R$ is a Jacobson ring, which lead me to believe that Semilocal rings are characterized by having a finite number of prime ideals, rather than just maximal. I now believe this is false, but I cannot come up with a counterexample. Any help would be greatly appreciated. abstract-algebra ring-theory commutative-algebra noetherian share|cite|improve this question edited Jan 19 '17 at 20:39 Watson 15.7k92870 asked Jan 19 '17 at 20:06 Pax Kivimae 3,34631233 What does the notation $P$ in $P(|Specm(R)|)$ mean, actually? – Watson Jan 26 '17 at 13:32 1 @Watson It is meant to denote the powerset – Pax Kivimae Jan 26 '17 at 22:28 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 3 down vote accepted You can try the local ring $\Bbb Q[X,Y]_{(X,Y)}$, which is noetherian (as localization of a noetherian ring — $\Bbb Q[X,Y]$ is noetherian by the Hilbert basis theorem). The ideals $(X+aY)$ in $\Bbb Q[X,Y]_{(X,Y)}$ are prime and pairwise distinct, so that the spectrum of $\Bbb Q[X,Y]_{(X,Y)}$ is infinite. share|cite|improve this answer answered Jan 19 '17 at 20:32 Watson 15.7k92870 I can't believe I didn't even check if for local rings. I think I might be a bit off today. Thank you so much! – Pax Kivimae Jan 19 '17 at 20:44 You can have other examples here or on this website (from this user). – Watson Jan 21 '17 at 11:42 @watson Hi: thanks for the suggestion! When I checked, I did not see another such ring in storage, so it is valuable indeed. I'd like to help flesh it out more, but I need a second opinion. It is UFD that is not a PID, is that correct? It seems like $(X,Y)$ should not be principal, but I just want to run it by another person. – rschwieb Jan 24 '17 at 19:26 @rschwieb : you're welcome :-). I agree that, as a localization of a UFD, it is a UFD, and it has dimension $2$, so it is not a PID. [By the way, it would be so great to have some property giving the Krull dimension of the rings at ringtheory.herokuapp.com – for instance there is an amazing example of Noetherian ring with infinite Krull dimension…] – Watson Jan 24 '17 at 19:43 1 @Watson I will think about adding it as something visible for commutative rings. As a substitute, I have been inserting it into the ring's extra info. But it would be nice to be able to search on Krull dimension for commutative rings :) – rschwieb Jan 24 '17 at 19:54 | show 5 more comments Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Mathematics Stack Exchange!
