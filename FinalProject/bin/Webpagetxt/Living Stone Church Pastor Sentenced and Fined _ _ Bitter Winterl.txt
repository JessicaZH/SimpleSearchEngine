Despite several appeals, Pastor Su and the church’s other pastor, Yang Hua, have been also fined over $1 million for collecting “illegal” donations from the congregation. Pastor Su has been under house arrest since December 2015, while Pastor Yang Hua was placed under criminal detention in December 2015 and sentenced to two and a half years in prison a year later. Last week, in Chengdu, Sichuan Province, authorities detained or removed over 200 members of the Early Rain Covenant Church to prevent them from holding a memorial service for victims of the Wenchuan earthquake of 2008. Among them was Pastor Wang Yi – an outspoken critic of the government’s policy towards unregistered or independent churches.
