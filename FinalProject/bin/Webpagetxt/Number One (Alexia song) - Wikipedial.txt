Once again the German edition would be released by ZYX, the Spanish release by Blanco Y Negro, the French release by Panic (a subsidiary of Polygram, the Finnish release by K-Tel and the Brazilian release by Spotlight. A full set of releases were commissioned for Europe by Sony Music, once again on their Dancepool label; a Maxi CD, 2 track CD and 12" release (Sony code 663995). Two remix releases followed; the 'Happy Remix and Spanish versions' remix release and a second release entitled 'remix'. All the tracks across these two vinyl releases were later released on one CD. This would be Alexia's second American release, once again through Popular Records in 1997, with "Me And You" being added on the releases. The American promotional 12" contained a new remix of Me And You, though it was mistakenly labelled the 'Extended Euromix'. Critical reception[edit] Billboard wrote about the song: "Import enthusiasts are already big fans of this fast-paced Italo-disco ditty. Alexia is a charming ingénue with the potential for great things, as evidenced in a performance that has more natural flair and earthy grit than is normally found on records like these. Producer Robyx surrounds her with a strobing dance beat and fluttering flamenco guitars, à la No Mercy's "Where Do You Go." One of several festive, hit-worthy jams on Alexia's forthcoming debut album, "Fun Club"."[2] Music & Media wrote: "Vocal dreamhouse by Italo producer Robyx. In the Club Short Mix, the usual piano is replaced by an acoustic guitar which gives the song that lucky holiday feeling."[3] Music video[edit] The music video for "Number One" was directed by Italian director Alessandra Pescetta.[4] It first aired in January 1997.
