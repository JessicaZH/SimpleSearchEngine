Consequent - Wikipedia Consequent From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search For other uses, see Consequence. Look up consequent in Wiktionary, the free dictionary. A consequent is the second half of a hypothetical proposition. In the standard form of such a proposition, it is the part that follows "then". In an implication, if P implies Q, then P is called the antecedent and Q is called the consequent.[1] In some contexts, the consequent is called the apodosis.[2] Examples: If P {\displaystyle P} , then Q {\displaystyle Q} . Q {\displaystyle Q} is the consequent of this hypothetical proposition. If X {\displaystyle X} is a mammal, then X {\displaystyle X} is an animal. Here, " X {\displaystyle X} is an animal" is the consequent. If computers can think, then they are alive. "They are alive" is the consequent. The consequent in a hypothetical proposition is not necessarily a consequence of the antecedent. If monkeys are purple, then fish speak Klingon. "Fish speak Klingon" is the consequent here, but intuitively is not a consequence of (nor does it have anything to do with) the claim made in the antecedent that "monkeys are purple".
