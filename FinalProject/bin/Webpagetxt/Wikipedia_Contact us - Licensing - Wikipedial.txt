An example of a freely licensed photograph Do you want to use something you've found on Wikipedia? Wikipedia is a freely licensed encyclopedia; most of our content can be copied and used for any purpose. The exception to this is content used as "fair use". Fair use media is clearly identified if you go to the page about that file; you should see that the file is identified as "fair use under United States copyright law. Other uses of this image, on Wikipedia or elsewhere, might be copyright infringement" in the "Licensing" section. Fair use text should be marked explicitly as a quotation. All other content should be freely licensed and open for your use as long as you meet the licensing conditions. For specifics, see our page on reusing Wikipedia content. We try hard to identify the sources and licenses of all media such as text, images or sounds used in our encyclopedia articles. Still, we cannot guarantee that all media are used or marked correctly. If an image description page states that an image was in the public domain, you should still check yourself whether that claim appears correct and decide for yourself whether your use of the image would be acceptable under the laws applicable to you. Are you concerned that something you've found here is in breach of copyright? If you're worried that we're using your copyrighted works improperly, you can email us at info-en-cwikimedia.org . Please provide the address or title of the page, and evidence to show that you are the legitimate copyright holder. If you prefer to use the formal OCILLA request, your DMCA takedown request must be sent to our designated agent. If you are not the copyright holder, we still welcome the information. See Wikipedia:Copyvio101 for how to flag the issue; alternatively, you can also use the email address above. You can also donate content, such as photographs, to Wikipedia. You can upload it yourself and then include it in the article, or you can email it to photosubmissionwikimedia.org . If you choose to email the content, please include the photograph in question, along with a statement that you own the copyright on it and an agreement to release it under a free license. Our recommended license is the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 license. The form at Wikipedia:Declaration of consent can be used for this purpose. Please note that submissions made by email may take several weeks to process. Finally, if the content you wish to donate is already online, you can submit a request that another user upload it for you. For more information about donating your copyrighted content, see Wikipedia:Donating copyrighted materials.
