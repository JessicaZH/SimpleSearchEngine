Ask Question up vote 1 down vote favorite Let $R$ be a commutative ring with $1$ and $\mathfrak{m}\subset R$ be a maximal ideal. Show that if $I\subset R$ is a proper ideal containing $\mathfrak{m}^n$ for some $n\geq 1$, then $\mathfrak{m}$ is the unique prime ideal containing $I$. This question was asked in a recent exam that i appeared, but could not solve it. Any hints would be highly appreciated. Thank you. What role does $n$ play? abstract-algebra commutative-algebra share|cite|improve this question asked Jun 25 '14 at 3:12 User101 509211 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 1 down vote accepted Let $p$ be a prime ideal containing $I$. Since $m^n \subseteq I$, $m^n \subseteq p$. This implies $m \subseteq p$. Since $m$ is maximal $m = p$. share|cite|improve this answer answered Jun 25 '14 at 3:16 Youngsu 1,751715 Ahh! it was so tricky! Thank you alot – User101 Jun 25 '14 at 3:19 Dear @User101 Quick question: what part was tricky? I'm asking this as a serious question because I'm unsure of your background. Regards. – rschwieb Jun 25 '14 at 13:00 1 Dear @rschwieb Dummit-foote's definition of prime ideal(sec 7.4) for commutative ring is: $P\neq R$ and $a\cdot b \in P$ implies either $a\in P$ or $b\in P$. Then we say $P$ is prime. I hadn't noticed that this definition could be generalized to the product of ideals. I hadn't realized that, so i felt it was tricky. Most members like you, have good grasp of mathematics, so these facts might remain trivial for them, but for me i need to explore a lot. Thank you any way. – User101 Jun 25 '14 at 19:42 1 Dear @User101 : Thanks for following up :) I was guessing that was your difficulty. I'm glad you discovered the equivalence, because it is very useful. That definition of "prime" is the one used for noncommutative rings as well. For noncommutative rings, it is not equivalent to the elementwise definition.
