NorthOne is looking for a Lead DevOps Engineer to join our team as we enter a new phase of product development. We are a Toronto-based, venture-backed, early-stage startup at the heart of the FinTech movement that is shaping the way financial services are delivered. Our story Our company’s purpose is to eliminate the pain that small business owners face through their financial management and banking. To achieve this, we’re re-imagining business banking from the ground up. Our product NorthOne is building a mobile-first, API-enabled banking platform serving startups and small and medium-sized business (SMBs). Poor financial literacy has an outsized impact on the costs and failure rates amongst SMBs, and we are on a mission to eliminate these problems. We are more than a banking platform, we are the world class Finance Department that SMBs could never afford. Our team We ❤ product. Thoughtful and rigorous product development makes us giddy. That’s why when it comes to product, everybody plays in the orchestra. We’ve got a fast moving team of full stack developers lead by our VP Engineering who’s spent over a decade building technology at both Fortune 500 companies and startups. Our COO has helped build digital products used by companies like Frank and Oak, Supercell, MachineZone, BMO, and Trivago. Oh, and our CEO? 6 years at McKinsey working on digital customer experience in financial services. We’re building a product that solves real pain, vs the imagined kind. Is this sounding like home yet? REQUIREMENTS Today you might be a Systems Engineer, Sys Admin, Developer Experience Engineer, Cyber Security Specialist, DevOps Engineer or the equivalent in your company...or something that we haven’t heard of yet - we keep an open mind. This attitude will make you successful on our team (note that this comes before all else): You get your hands dirty: You are comfortable diving into new projects, exploring other’s code. Whatever it is, you like to stretch outside your swimlane. You’re curious: You’re excited about the bleeding edge of tech without being dogmatic about any language or framework and are excited to passionately share your views with us. You get that tech is a team sport: You understand that learning from and teaching other great developers makes the whole team better. You’re mission first: You get stuff done and you don’t let anything get in the way of moving our product forward. The skills that will make you successful in this role: Getting things done: Required: Expert knowledge in at least one modern programming language, experience with relational and nonrelational databases, worked with complex and secure server architectures (e.g., distributed, stateless), deep knowledge of API protocols, expert knowledge of AWS (e.g., Redshift, IAM) and track record of building and maintaining secure systems and applications, built and/or maintained CI/CD pipelines, deep knowledge of Docker. Nice to have: Dev ops experience, you’ve worked with AWS (e.g., Redshift, IAM) and understand how to build secure systems and applications, NodeJS, mobile UX design, system architecture, you've worked in a regulated industry (banking, etc.) Getting things done securely: You’re obsessed with security and know how to spot a vulnerability before anyone else. You’re not paranoid, you’re just great at your job. Experiences and stories you can tell us around the campfire: Building honeypots and tripping up bad guys Scaling a system from 0 to 1000s of users (or more!) Automating AWS to squeeze all the performance and capacity out of your budget Planning for crises, working through them when they were unavoidable BENEFITS Our mission is big and audacious, but we're assembling a team to take the challenge head-on. As a Lead DevOps Engineer, you'll be joining a strong team, and you'll contribute to our success across all parts of the company: People: Our company is more than just a business. We’re a band of brothers and sisters supporting each other on our mission to rebuild business banking. We’re really serious about mission, fit, and the people we work with. Product: People are trusting us with their money. We don’t take this responsibility lightly. You’re building a product that is as secure and dependable as it is beautiful and ingenious. Technology ownership: You’re right in the thick of it, making critical technical decisions that will move us forward. You’re a blend of Geordie Laforge, Diane Greene, and Tony Stark. We offer full health/dental benefits, competitive compensation/equity, and one hell of an adventure. If you're up for the challenge, let's talk.
