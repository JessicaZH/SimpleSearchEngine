Traci Redford was preparing to pre-board a flight from John Wayne Airport in Orange County to El Paso, Texas, reports Los Angeles TV station KABC. "The gate agent started mocking my child's name, laughing, pointing at me and my daughter, and talking to other employees," Redford told KABC. "So I turned around and just said 'Hey, I can hear you. If i can hear you, my daughter can too. I'd appreciate it if you'd just stop'."

"We take great pride in extending our Southwest Hospitality to all of our customers, which includes living by the Golden Rule and treating every individual with respect, in person or online."
