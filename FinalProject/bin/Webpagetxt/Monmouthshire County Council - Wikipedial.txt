The current unitary authority was created in 1996 and covers the eastern half of the historic county. As of May 2017, the council is led by Peter Fox (Conservative), with Robert Greenland (Conservative) as Deputy Leader. The Chief executive is Paul Matthews.[2] Contents 1 History 2 Elections 2.1 Current composition (2017) 2.2 Historic results 3 Electoral districts, areas and communities 3.1 Bryn y Cwm area 3.2 Central Monmouthshire area 3.3 Lower Wye area 3.4 Severnside 4 References History[edit] A Monmouthshire County Council was originally formed in 1889, covering the administrative county of Monmouthshire. The council was based at Shire Hall in Newport. In 1891 Newport became a county borough and therefore outside the jurisdiction of the county council, although the council continued to be based there. The council was abolished in 1974, being absorbed into Gwent. However, a new Monmouthshire County Council was formed in 1996 covering the principal area of Monmouthshire. This council was a successor to the previous Monmouth District Council along with a small part of the former Blaenau Gwent District Council area, which themselves were created in 1974. Until April 2012, the council's administrative headquarters were at the former Gwent County Hall at Croesyceiliog, Cwmbran – also outside its own jurisdiction in the neighbouring borough of Torfaen – which closed because of "concrete cancer". The authority decided to relocate some of its headquarters functions to offices at Coleg Gwent, Usk.[3] In May 2010 it was reported that the council had purchased additional offices at the Wales 1 Business Park at Magor.[4] Planning permission for a new office building at Usk, to provide the authority's central facilities, was granted in September 2011.[5] The new county hall in Usk was opened in 2013.[6][7][8] Elections[edit] Councillor Peter Fox, Conservative, Leader of the Council Elections take place every four years. Following the election on 3 May 2012, a working arrangement was established by the Conservative and Liberal Democrat groups to run the authority. Peter Fox (Conservative) was appointed as Leader, with Robert Greenland (Conservative) and Phylip Hobson (Liberal Democrat) as Deputy Leaders. In the elections, the two parties won a combined total of 22 seats, giving them an overall majority of one.[9] In May 2017, the Conservative party won overall control. Cllr Peter Fox began his fifth term as council leader.[10] Monmouthshire County Council became the only council in Wales under Conservative majority control. The Conservatives had previously controlled the authority from the 2004 elections, when they took it from no overall control. They increased their majority in the council election of 2008.

These divisions date from 2004.[12] The council operates a decentralised system of administration, with four area committees: Bryn y Cwm, covering the Abergavenny area Central Monmouthshire, centred on Monmouth Lower Wye, for the Chepstow area Severnside, the area around Caldicot[13] Although the council is described as a "unitary authority", there is in fact a second tier of government, with the entire area being divided into communities, all of which has either a town or community council.
