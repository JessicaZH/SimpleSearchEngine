Ethnic groups in Europe - Wikipedia Ethnic groups in Europe From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search "Europeans" redirects here. For other uses, see European (disambiguation). Overview map of the distribution of the major languages of Europe. The indigenous peoples of Europe are the focus of European ethnology, the field of anthropology related to the various indigenous groups that reside in the nations of Europe. According to German monograph Minderheitenrechte in Europa co-edited by Pan and Pfeil (2002) there are 87 distinct peoples of Europe, of which 33 form the majority population in at least one sovereign state, while the remaining 54 constitute ethnic minorities. The total number of national or linguistic minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of 770 million Europeans.[1] There is some precise or universally accepted definition of the terms "ethnic group" or "nationality". In the context of European ethnography in particular, the terms ethnic group, people, nationality or ethno-linguistic group, are used as mostly synonymous, although preference may vary in usage with respect to the situation specific to the individual countries of Europe.[2] Contents 1 Overview 2 Linguistic classifications 3 History 3.1 Prehistoric populations 3.2 Historical populations 3.3 Historical immigration 3.4 History of European ethnography 4 Minorities 4.1 Non-indigenous minorities 5 European identity 5.1 Historical 5.2 European culture 5.3 Religion 5.4 Pan-European identity 6 European ethnic groups by sovereign state 7 See also 8 Notes 9 References 10 Bibliography 11 External links Overview[edit] Further information: Demographics of Europe There are eight European ethno-linguistic groups with more than 30 million members residing in Europe. These eight groups between themselves account for some 465 million or about 65% of European population: Russians (over 100 million residing in Europe),[a] Germans (c. 93 million),[b] French (c. 75 million),[c][d] British (c. 66 million),[e][3] Italians (c. 60 million),[4][f] Ukrainians (38–55 million),[g] Spanish (41–50 million),[h] Polish (38–45 million).[i] Smaller ethno-linguistic groups with more than 10 million people residing in Europe include: Romanians (20–25 million)[j], Dutch (15–25 millon)[k], Turks (10–20 million in Europe), Portuguese (10–15 million), Swedes (10–15 million), Greeks (10–15 million), Czechs (c. 10 million), Hungarians (c. 10 million), Serbs (c. 10 million). About 20–25 million residents (3%)[year needed] are members of diasporas of non-European origin. The population of the European Union, with some five hundred million residents, accounts for two thirds of the European population. Both Spain and the United Kingdom are special cases, in that the designation of nationality, Spanish and British, may controversially take ethnic aspects, subsuming various regional ethnic groups, see nationalisms and regionalisms of Spain and native populations of the United Kingdom. Switzerland is a similar case, but the linguistic subgroups of the Swiss are discussed in terms of both ethnicity and language affiliations. Linguistic classifications[edit] Further information: Languages of Europe Of the total population of Europe of some 740 million (as of 2010), close to 90% (or some 650 million) fall within three large branches of Indo-European languages, these being; Balto-Slavic, including Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Croatian, Macedonian, Czech, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Slovenian, Serbian, Slovak, Belarusian, Ruthenian, Latvian, and Lithuanian. Romance, including; Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, Catalan, Corsican, Friulian, Aromanian, Walloon, Romansh, Latin, and Sardinian. Germanic, including; English, German, Dutch, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Flemish, Luxembourgish, Icelandic, Frisian, Limburgish, Low Saxon and Faeroese. Afrikaans, a daughter language of Dutch, is spoken by some South African and Namibian migrant populations. Three stand-alone Indo-European languages do not fall within larger sub-groups and are not closely related to those larger language families; Greek (about 12 million) Albanian (about 4 million) Armenian (about 3.5 million) In addition, there are also smaller sub-groups within the Indo-European languages of Europe, including; Celtic (including Welsh, Breton, Irish Gaelic, Scots Gaelic, Cornish and Manx) Iranic, mainly Ossetian in Europe, as well as Kurdish (spoken mainly in Turkey) Indo-Aryan is represented by the Romani language spoken by Roma people of eastern Europe, and is at root related to the Indo-Aryan languages of the Indian sub-Continent. Besides the Indo-European languages, there are other language families on the European continent which are wholly unrelated to Indo-European: Uralic languages, including; Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian, Mordvin, Samoyedic, Sami, Komi, Udmurt and Mari. Turkic languages, including; Turkish, Azeri, Tatar, Nogai, Bashkir and Chuvash. Semitic languages, including; Maltese, Assyrian Neo-Aramaic spoken in parts of eastern Turkey and the Caucasus by Assyrian Christians, and Hebrew, the latter spoken by some Jewish populations. Kartvelian languages (also known as South Caucasian languages), including Georgian, Mingrelian, Zan, Svan and Laz. Northwest Caucasian languages, including; Circassian, Kabardian, Ubykh, Adyghe, Abkhaz and Abaza. Northeast Caucasian languages, including; Chechen, Avar, Lak, Lezgian, Ingush and Nakho-Dagestanian. Language isolates; Basque, spoken in the Basque regions of Spain and France is an isolate language, the only one in Europe, and is unrelated to any other language, living or extinct. Mongolic languages exist in the form of Kalmyk spoken in the Caucasus region of Russia. History[edit] Prehistoric populations[edit] Further information: Genetic history of Europe, Prehistoric Europe, Eurasian nomads, and Indo-European expansion The Basques have been found to descend from the population of the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age directly.[5][6] The Indo-European groups of Europe (the Centum groups plus Balto-Slavic and Albanian) are assumed to have developed in situ by admixture of Bronze Age, proto-Indo-European groups with earlier Mesolithic and Neolithic populations, after migrating to most of Europe from the Pontic steppe (Yamna culture, Corded ware, Beaker people).[7][8][9] The Finnic peoples are assumed to also be descended from Proto-Uralic populations further to the east, nearer to the Ural Mountains, that had migrated to their historical homelands in Europe by about 3,000 years ago.[10] Reconstructed languages of Iron Age Europe include Proto-Celtic, Proto-Italic and Proto-Germanic, all of these Indo-European languages of the centum group, and Proto-Slavic and Proto-Baltic, of the satem group. A group of Tyrrhenian languages appears to have included Etruscan, Rhaetian and perhaps also Eteocretan and Eteocypriot. A pre-Roman stage of Proto-Basque can only be reconstructed with great uncertainty. Regarding the European Bronze Age, the only secure reconstruction is that of Proto-Greek (ca. 2000 BC). A Proto-Italo-Celtic ancestor of both Italic and Celtic (assumed for the Bell beaker period), and a Proto-Balto-Slavic language (assumed for roughly the Corded Ware horizon) has been postulated with less confidence. Old European hydronymy has been taken as indicating an early (Bronze Age) Indo-European predecessor of the later centum languages. Historical populations[edit] Further information: History of Europe Provinces of the Roman Empire in AD 117. Iron Age (pre-Great Migrations) populations of Europe known from Greco-Roman historiography, notably Herodotus, Pliny, Ptolemy and Tacitus: Aegean: Greek tribes, Pelasgians/Tyrrhenians, and Anatolians. Balkans: Illyrians (List of ancient tribes in Illyria), Dacians, and Thracians. Italian peninsula: Italic peoples, Etruscans, Adriatic Veneti, Ligurians and Greek colonies. Western/Central Europe: Celts (list of peoples of Gaul, List of Celtic tribes), Rhaetians and Swabians, Vistula Veneti, Lugii and Balts. Iberian peninsula: Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula (Iberians, Lusitani, Aquitani, Celtiberians) Basques and Phoenicians ( Carthaginians). Sardinia: ancient Sardinians (also known as Nuragic people), comprising the Corsi, Balares and Ilienses tribes. West European Isles: Celtic tribes in Britain and Ireland and Picts/Priteni. Northern Europe: Finnic peoples, Germanic peoples (list of Germanic peoples). Southern Europe: Sicani. Eastern Europe: Scythians, Sarmatians. Historical immigration[edit] Further information: Scythians, Huns, Turkic expansion, and Islamic conquests The Great Migrations of Late Antiquity. Map showing the three main political divisions around 800: The Carolingian Empire (purple), the Byzantine Empire (orange) and the Caliphate of Córdoba (light green). (Borders are approximate.) Ethno-linguistic groups that arrived from outside Europe during historical times are: Phoenician colonies in the Mediterranean (including regions in Spain, France, Malta, Italy and the Aegean), from about 1200 BC to the fall of Carthage after the Third Punic War in 146 BC. Assyrian conquest of Cyprus, Southern Caucasus (including parts of modern Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan) and Cilicia during the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911-605 BC) Iranian influence: Achaemenid control of Thrace (512–343 BC) and the Bosporan Kingdom, Cimmerians (possible Iranians), Scythians, Sarmatians, Alans, Ossetes. the Jewish diaspora reached Europe in the Roman Empire period, the Jewish community in Italy dating to around AD 70 and records of Jews settling Central Europe (Gaul) from the 5th century (see History of the Jews in Europe). The Hunnic Empire (5th century), converged with the Barbarian invasions, contributing to the formation of the First Bulgarian Empire Avar Khaganate (c.560s-800), converged with the Slavic migrations, fused into the South Slavic states from the 9th century. the Bulgars (or Proto-Bulgarians), a semi-nomadic people, originally from Central Asia, eventually absorbed by the Slavs. the Magyars (Hungarians), a Ugric people, and the Turkic Pechenegs and Khazars, arrived in Europe in about the 8th century (see Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin). the Arabs conquered Cyprus, Crete, Sicily, some places along the coast of southern Italy, Malta, Greek Empire, Hispania and, in the early 11th century, Emirate of Sicily (831–1072, expelled in 1224) and Al-Andalus (711–1492, expelled) the Berber dynasties of the Almoravides and the Almohads ruled much of Spain and Portugal.[11] exodus of Maghreb Christians[12] the western Kipchaks known as Cumans entered the lands of present-day Ukraine in the 11th century. the Mongol/Tatar invasions (1223–1480), and Ottoman control of the Balkans (1389–1878). These medieval incursions account for the presence of European Turks and Tatars. the Romani people (Gypsies) arrived during the Late Middle Ages the Mongol Kalmyks arrived in Kalmykia in the 17th century. History of European ethnography[edit] Europa Polyglotta, Linguarum Genealogiam exhibens, una cum Literis, Scribendique modis, Omnium Gentium ("multilingual Europe, exhibiting a genealogy of tongues together with the letters and modes of writing of all peoples"), from Synopsis Universae Philologiae (1741). Ethnographic map of Europe, The Times Atlas (1896). The earliest accounts of European ethnography date to Classical Antiquity. Herodotus described the Scythians and Thraco-Illyrians. Dicaearchus gave a description of Greece itself besides accounts of western and northern Europe. His work survives only fragmentarily, but was received by Polybius and others. Roman Empire period authors include Diodorus Siculus, Strabo and Tacitus. Julius Caesar gives an account of the Celtic tribes of Gaul, while Tacitus describes the Germanic tribes of Magna Germania. A number of authors like Diodorus Siculus, Pausanias and Sallust depicts the ancient Sardinian and Corsican peoples. The 4th century Tabula Peutingeriana records the names of numerous peoples and tribes. Ethnographers of Late Antiquity such as Agathias of Myrina Ammianus Marcellinus, Jordanes or Theophylact Simocatta give early accounts of the Slavs, the Franks, the Alamanni and the Goths. Book IX of Isidore's Etymologiae (7th century) treats de linguis, gentibus, regnis, militia, civibus (of languages, peoples, realms, armies and cities). Ahmad ibn Fadlan in the 10th century gives an account of the Bolghar and the Rus' peoples. William Rubruck, while most notable for his account of the Mongols, in his account of his journey to Asia also gives accounts of the Tatars and the Alans. Saxo Grammaticus and Adam of Bremen give an account of pre-Christian Scandinavia. The Chronicon Slavorum (12th century) gives an account of the northwestern Slavic tribes. Gottfried Hensel in his 1741 Synopsis Universae Philologiae published what is probably the earliest ethno-linguistic map of Europe, showing the beginning of the pater noster in the various European languages and scripts.[13][14] In the 19th century, ethnicity was discussed in terms of scientific racism, and the ethnic groups of Europe were grouped into a number of "races", Mediterranean, Alpine and Nordic, all part of a larger "Caucasian" group. The beginnings of ethnic geography as an academic subdiscipline lie in the period following World War I, in the context of nationalism, and in the 1930s exploitation for the purposes of fascist and Nazi propaganda so that it was only in the 1960s that ethnic geography began to thrive as a bona fide academic subdiscipline.[15] The origins of modern ethnography are often traced to the work of Bronisław Malinowski who emphasized the importance of fieldwork.[16] The emergence of population genetics further undermined the categorisation of Europeans into clearly defined racial groups. A 2007 study on the genetic history of Europe found that the most important genetic differentiation in Europe occurs on a line from the north to the south-east (northern Europe to the Balkans), with another east-west axis of differentiation across Europe, separating the "indigenous" Basques and Sami from other European populations. Despite these stratifications it noted the unusually high degree of European homogeneity: "there is low apparent diversity in Europe with the entire continent-wide samples only marginally more dispersed than single population samples elsewhere in the world."[17][18][19] Minorities[edit] Further information: Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities and European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages Further information: Multilingual countries and regions of Europe The total number of national minority populations in Europe is estimated at 105 million people, or 14% of Europeans.[1] The member states of the Council of Europe in 1995 signed the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The broad aims of the Convention are to ensure that the signatory states respect the rights of national minorities, undertaking to combat discrimination, promote equality, preserve and develop the culture and identity of national minorities, guarantee certain freedoms in relation to access to the media, minority languages and education and encourage the participation of national minorities in public life. The Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities defines a national minority implicitly to include minorities possessing a territorial identity and a distinct cultural heritage. By 2008, 39 member states have signed and ratified the Convention, with the notable exception of France. Non-indigenous minorities[edit] Main article: Immigration to Europe Further information: Jews and Judaism in Europe, Islam in Europe, Hinduism in Europe, Buddhism in Europe, and Afro-Europeans Many non-European ethnic groups and nationalities have immigrated to Europe over the centuries. Some arrived centuries ago, while others immigrated more recently in the 20th century, often from former colonies of the British, Dutch, French, Portuguese and Spanish empires. Western Asians Jews: approx. 2.0 million, mostly in France, the UK and Germany. They are descended from the Israelites of the Middle East (Southwest Asia),[20][21][22][23][24][25][26] originating from the historical kingdoms of Israel and Judah.[27][28][29][30] Ashkenazi Jews: approx. 1.4 million, mostly in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Ukraine. They are believed by scholars to have arrived from Israel via southern Europe[31][32][33][34][35] in the Roman era[36] and settled in France and Germany towards the end of the first millennium. The Nazi Holocaust wiped out the vast majority during World War II and forced most to flee, with many of them going back to Israel. Sephardi Jews: approx. 0.3 million, mostly in France. They arrived via Spain and Portugal in the pre-Roman[37] and Roman[38] eras, and were forcibly converted or expelled in the 15th and 16th centuries. Mizrahi Jews: approx. 0.3 million, mostly in France, via Islamic-majority countries of the Middle East. Italqim: approx. 50,000, mostly in Italy, since the 2nd century BC. Romaniotes: approx. 6,000, mostly in Greece, with communities dating at least from the 1st century AD. Crimean Karaites (Karaim): less than 4,000, mostly in Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. They arrived in Crimea in the Middle Ages. Assyrians: mostly in Sweden and Germany, as well in Russia, Armenia, Denmark and Great Britain (see Assyrian diaspora). Assyrians have been present in Eastern Turkey since the Bronze Age (circa 2000 BCE). Kurds: approx. 2.5 million, mostly in the UK, Germany, Sweden and Turkey. Iraqi diaspora: mostly in the UK, Germany and Sweden, and can be of varying ethnic origin, including Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Armenians, Shabaks, Mandeans, Turcoman, Kawliya and Yezidis. Lebanese diaspora: especially in France, Netherlands, Germany, Cyprus and the UK.[39] Syrian diaspora: Largest number of Syrians live in Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden and can be of varying ethnic origin, including; Arabs, Assyrians, Kurds, Armenians, Arameans, Turcoman, Mhallami and Yezidis. Africans North Africans (Arabs and Berbers): approx. 5 million, mostly in France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. The bulk of North African migrants are Moroccans, although France also has a large number of Algerians, and others may be from Egypt (including Copts), Libya and Tunisia. Horn Africans (Somalis, Ethiopians, Eritreans, Djiboutians, and the Northern Sudanese): approx. 700,000, mostly in Scandinavia, the UK, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Finland, and Italy. Majority arrived to Europe as refugees. Proportionally few live in Italy despite former colonial ties, most live in the Nordic countries. Sub-Saharan Africans (many ethnicities including Afro-Caribbeans and others by descent): approx. 5 million, mostly in the UK and France, with smaller numbers in the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal and elsewhere.[40] Latin Americans: approx. 2.2 million, mainly in Spain and to a lesser extent Italy and the UK.[41] See also Latin American Britons (80,000 Latin American born in 2001).[42] Brazilians: around 70,000 in Portugal and Italy each, and 50,000 in Germany. Chilean refugees escaping the Augusto Pinochet regime of the 1970s formed communities in France, Sweden, the UK, former East Germany and the Netherlands. Venezuelans: around 520,000 mostly in Spain (200,000), Portugal (100,000), France (30,000), Germany (20,000), UK (15,000), Ireland (5,000), Italy (5,000) and the Netherlands (1,000).[citation needed] South Asians: approx. 3–4 million, mostly in the UK but reside in smaller numbers in Germany and France. Romani (Gypsies): approx. 4 or 10 million (although estimates vary widely), dispersed throughout Europe but with large numbers concentrated in the Balkans area, they are of ancestral South Asian and European descent,[43] originating from the northern regions of the Indian subcontinent. Indians: approx. 2 million, mostly in the UK, also in Italy, in Germany and smaller numbers in Ireland. Pakistanis: approx. 1,000,000, mostly in the UK and in Italy, but also in Norway and Sweden. Tamils: approx. 250,000, predominantly in the UK. Bangladeshi residing in Europe estimated at over 500,000, mostly in the UK and in Italy. Sri Lankans: approx. 200,000, mainly in the UK and in Italy Nepalese: approx. 50,000 in the UK Afghans, about 100,000 to 200,000, most happen to live in the UK, but Germany and Sweden are destinations for Afghan immigrants since the 1960s. Southeast Asians Filipinos: above 1 million, mostly in Italy, the UK, France, Germany, Spain. Others of multiple nationalities, ca. total 1 million, such as Indonesians in the Netherlands, Thais in the UK and Sweden, Vietnamese in France and former East Germany, and Cambodians in France, together with Burmese, Malaysian, Singaporean, Timorese and Laotian migrants. See also Vietnamese people in the Czech Republic. East Asians Chinese: approx. 1.7 million, mostly in France, Russia, the UK, Spain, Italy and the Netherlands. Japanese: mostly in the UK and a sizable community in Düsseldorf, Germany. Koreans: 100,000 estimated (excludes a possible 100,000 more in Russia), mainly in the UK, France and Germany. See also Koryo-saram. Mongolians are a sizable community in Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic. North Americans U.S. and Canadian expatriates: American British and Canadian British, Canadiens and Acadians in France, as well Americans/Canadians of European ancestry residing elsewhere in Europe. African Americans (i.e. African American British) who are Americans of black/African ancestry reside in other countries. In the 1920s, African-American entertainers established a colony in Paris (African American French) and descendants of World War II/Cold War-era black American soldiers stationed in France, Germany and Italy are well known. Others European diaspora – Australians, New Zealanders, South Africans (mostly White South Africans of Afrikaaner and British descent), and white Namibians, Zimbabweans, Kenyans, Malawians and Zambians mainly in the UK, together with white Angolans and Mozambicans, mainly of Portuguese descent. Pacific Islanders: A small population of Tahitians of Polynesian origin in mainland France, Fijians in the United Kingdom from Fiji and Māori in the United Kingdom of the Māori people of New Zealand, a small number of Tongans and Samoans, also in the United Kingdom. Amerindians and Inuit, a scant few in the European continent of American Indian ancestry (often Latin Americans in Spain, France and the UK; Inuit in Denmark), but most may be children or grandchildren of U.S. soldiers from American Indian tribes by intermarriage with local European women. An estimated 60,000 American Indians may live in Germany as of the 2010s. European identity[edit] Historical[edit] Further information: History of Western civilization Personifications of Sclavinia, Germania, Gallia, and Roma, bringing offerings to Otto III; from a gospel book dated 990. Medieval notions of a relation of the peoples of Europe are expressed in terms of genealogy of mythical founders of the individual groups. The Europeans were considered the descendants of Japheth from early times, corresponding to the division of the known world into three continents, the descendants of Shem peopling Asia and those of Ham peopling Africa. Identification of Europeans as "Japhetites" is also reflected in early suggestions for terming the Indo-European languages "Japhetic". In this tradition, the Historia Brittonum (9th century) introduces a genealogy of the peoples of the Migration period (as it was remembered in early medieval historiography) as follows, The first man that dwelt in Europe was Alanus, with his three sons, Hisicion, Armenon, and Neugio. Hisicion had four sons, Francus, Romanus, Alamanus, and Bruttus. Armenon had five sons, Gothus, Valagothus, Cibidus, Burgundus, and Longobardus. Neugio had three sons, Vandalus, Saxo, and Boganus. From Hisicion arose four nations—the Franks, the Latins, the Germans, and Britons; from Armenon, the Gothi, Valagothi, Cibidi, Burgundi, and Longobardi; from Neugio, the Bogari, Vandali, Saxones, and Tarincgi. The whole of Europe was subdivided into these tribes.[44] The text goes then on to list the genealogy of Alanus, connecting him to Japheth via eighteen generations. European culture[edit] Main articles: Culture of Europe and Western culture European culture is largely rooted in what is often referred to as its "common cultural heritage".[45] Due to the great number of perspectives which can be taken on the subject, it is impossible to form a single, all-embracing conception of European culture.[46] Nonetheless, there are core elements which are generally agreed upon as forming the cultural foundation of modern Europe.[47] One list of these elements given by K. Bochmann includes:[48] A common cultural and spiritual heritage derived from Greco-Roman antiquity, Christianity, the Renaissance and its Humanism, the political thinking of the Enlightenment, and the French Revolution, and the developments of Modernity, including all types of socialism;[49] A rich and dynamic material culture that has been extended to the other continents as the result of industrialization and colonialism during the "Great Divergence";[49] A specific conception of the individual expressed by the existence of, and respect for, a legality that guarantees human rights and the liberty of the individual;[49] A plurality of states with different political orders, which are condemned to live together in one way or another;[49] Respect for peoples, states and nations outside Europe.[49] Berting says that these points fit with "Europe's most positive realisations".[50] The concept of European culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the Western world. In this definition, Western culture is the set of literary, scientific, political, artistic and philosophical principles which set it apart from other civilizations. Much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the Western canon.[51] The term has come to apply to countries whose history has been strongly marked by European immigration or settlement during the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the Americas, and Australasia, and is not restricted to Europe. Religion[edit] Main articles: Religion in Europe and Christendom Further information: Christianity in Europe, Islam in Europe, Hinduism in Europe, and Buddhism in Europe Eurobarometer Poll 2005 chart results Since the High Middle Ages, most of Europe is dominated by Christianity. There are three major denominations, Roman Catholic, Protestant and Eastern Orthodox, with Protestantism restricted mostly to Northern Europe, and Orthodoxy to East and South Slavic regions, Romania, Greece and Georgia. Also The Armenian Apostolic Church, part of the Oriental Church, is in Europe - another branch of Christianity (world's oldest National Church). Catholicism, while typically centered in Western Europe, also has a very significant following in Central Europe (especially among the Germanic, Western Slavic and Hungarian peoples/regions) as well as in Ireland (with some in Great Britain). Christianity has been the dominant religion shaping European culture for at least the last 1700 years.[52][53][54][55][56] Modern philosophical thought has very much been influenced by Christian philosophers such as St Thomas Aquinas and Erasmus. And throughout most of its history, Europe has been nearly equivalent to Christian culture,[57] The Christian culture was the predominant force in western civilization, guiding the course of philosophy, art, and science.[58][59] The notion of "Europe" and the "Western World" has been intimately connected with the concept of "Christianity and Christendom" many even attribute Christianity for being the link that created a unified European identity.[60] Christianity is still the largest religion in Europe; according to a 2011 survey, 76.2% of Europeans considered themselves Christians.[61][62] Also according to a study on Religiosity in the European Union in 2012, by Eurobarometer, Christianity is the largest religion in the European Union, accounting for 72% of the EU's population.[63] Islam has some tradition in the Balkans and the Caucasus due to conquest and colonization from the Ottoman Empire in the 16th to 19th centuries. Muslims account for the majority of the populations in Albania, Azerbaijan, Kosovo, Northern Cyprus (controlled by Turks), and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Significant minorities are present in the rest of Europe. Russia also has one of the largest Muslim communities in Europe, including the Tatars of the Middle Volga and multiple groups in the Caucasus, including Chechens, Avars, Ingush and others. With 20th-century migrations, Muslims in Western Europe have become a noticeable minority. According to the Pew Forum, the total number of Muslims in Europe in 2010 was about 44 million (6%),[64][64][64][65][64] while the total number of Muslims in the European Union in 2007 was about 16 million (3.2%).[66] Judaism has a long history in Europe, but is a small minority religion, with France (1%) the only European country with a Jewish population in excess of 0.5%. The Jewish population of Europe is composed primarily of two groups, the Ashkenazi and the Sephardi. Ancestors of Ashkenazi Jews likely migrated to Central Europe at least as early as the 8th century, while Sephardi Jews established themselves in Spain and Portugal at least one thousand years before that. Jews originated in the Levant where they resided for thousands of years until the 2nd century AD, when they spread around the Mediterranean and into Europe, although small communities were known to exist in Greece as well as the Balkans since at least the 1st century BC. Jewish history was notably affected by the Holocaust and emigration (including Aliyah, as well as emigration to America) in the 20th century. In modern times, significant secularization since the 20th century, notably in laicist France, Estonia and Czech Republic. Currently, distribution of theism in Europe is very heterogeneous, with more than 95% in Poland, and less than 20% in the Czech Republic and Estonia. The 2005 Eurobarometer poll[67] found that 52% of EU citizens believe in God. Pan-European identity[edit] Main article: Pan-European identity "Pan-European identity" or "Europatriotism" is an emerging sense of personal identification with Europe, or the European Union as a result of the gradual process of European integration taking place over the last quarter of the 20th century, and especially in the period after the end of the Cold War, since the 1990s. The foundation of the OSCE following the 1990s Paris Charter has facilitated this process on a political level during the 1990s and 2000s. From the later 20th century, 'Europe' has come to be widely used as a synonym for the European Union even though there are millions of people living on the European continent in non-EU member states. The prefix pan implies that the identity applies throughout Europe, and especially in an EU context, and 'pan-European' is often contrasted with national identity.[68] European ethnic groups by sovereign state[edit] Pan and Pfeil (2002) distinguish 33 peoples which form the majority population in at least one[l] sovereign state geographically situated in Europe.[m] These majorities range from nearly homogeneous populations as in Armenia and Poland, to comparatively slight majorities as in Latvia or Belgium, or even the marginal majority in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Montenegro is a multiethnic state in which no group forms a majority. Country Majority % Regional majorities Minorities[n] Albania Albanians 82.58%[69] Greeks ~3%,[70][better source needed][71] and other 2% (Aromanians, Romani, Bulgarians, Macedonians and Serbo-Montenegrins).[72] Armenia Armenians 98.1% Yazidis 1.2%, Russians 0.4% and others 0.3%.[73][74] Austria Austrians - Germans 85% ex-Yugoslavs 5.2%, Turks 2.2, Hungarians 1% and others or unspecified 6.6%.[75] Azerbaijan[o] Azerbaijanis 91.6% Lezgins 2% Armenians, Russians, Talysh, Avars, Turks, Tatars, Ukrainians and Poles.
