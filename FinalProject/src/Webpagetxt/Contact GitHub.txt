Projects hosted on GitHub Do you have a question about a project that's hosted on GitHub? GitHub hosts millions of projects, each with their own unique workflows. While we can help with issues related to GitHub.com, we aren't able to answer questions about projects that are hosted on GitHub. To get help with your project-specific questions, check the project's README file for an official website or contact information. You can also use the GitHub project's issue tracker, contact the project's mailing list (if it has one), or contact the project owner directly by checking their GitHub profile for contact details. GitHub Pages Are you seeing a GitHub Pages error? One of the most common problems GitHub Pages users run into is not seeing changes that they've made to their site. After you push a new commit to your repository, it can take up to 10 minutes for the GitHub Pages build process to complete and for your changes to appear. If it's been over 10 minutes and your changes still haven't appeared, your browser may be serving a cached version of the page. To fix this, you can reset your browser's cache or visit your site in incognito or in a private browsing window. If you need help with other GitHub Pages errors, see our official help documentation.
