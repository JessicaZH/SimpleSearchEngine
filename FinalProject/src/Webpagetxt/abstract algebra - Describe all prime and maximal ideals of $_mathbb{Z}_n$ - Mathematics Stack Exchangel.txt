I think I've figured out that $\mathbb{Z}_p$ where p is a prime that divides n make up the maximal ideals. I have no idea how to figure out which are prime.

The Chinese remainder theorem implies that $\mathbb{Z}_m\simeq \mathbb{Z}/p_1^{n_1}\times...\times \mathbb{Z}/p_1^{n_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m/p_1^{n_1}..p_i^{n_i-1}..p_n^{i_n}\simeq\mathbb{Z}/p_i$. share|cite|improve this answer edited Dec 17 '17 at 2:27 answered Dec 17 '17 at 2:22 Tsemo Aristide 54.7k11444 so what are the prime ideals? I don't really follow this – John Smith Dec 17 '17 at 2:31 the prime and maximal are the same – Tsemo Aristide Dec 17 '17 at 2:33 add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Mathematics Stack Exchange!
