Any new articles that have an interesting or unusual fact in them should be suggested for the Did you know? box on the Main Page. EFAF European Championship It's very rough and likely needs significant overhall. Additionally, it need to be sourced. BDota (talk) 02:23, 8 June 2010 (UTC) Oceania Federation of American Football New York Yankees (1936 AFL) is now a stub, leaving only the Boston Shamrocks as the only member of AFL I, AFL II, AFL III, or AFL IV without a standalone article (it is currently a redirect). In addition, American Football League (1938) has been expanded and moved to Midwest Football League, its longer-running predecessor. B.Wind (talk) 22:19, 8 March 2009 (UTC) Louisville Tanks is up and running - four league championships in its five season existence. B.Wind (talk) 23:22, 15 February 2009 (UTC) Buffalo Indians has been expanded; new American Football League (1934) has been written. B.Wind (talk) 20:20, 29 December 2008 (UTC) New stubs have been written for AFL III teams Boston Bears (AFL), Milwaukee Chiefs (AFL), and Buffalo Indians. These and the other AFL III stubs (Cincinnati Bengals (AFL) - the only team to have been in three AFLs - Columbus Bullies, and New York Yankees (1940 AFL) all need more information, but at least they're stubs. B.Wind (talk) 23:49, 2 November 2008 (UTC) Association of Professional Football Leagues - new article covering the compact between the "big three" and the NFL (1946-1948) and the first (only?) attempt to form the football analog of Organized Baseball. B.Wind (talk) 20:10, 12 October 2008 (UTC) Dixie League (football) - a new article of a significant minor ("big three") league, including an account of how a successful league imploded when one of its charter members jumped to another league. B.Wind (talk) 00:10, 12 October 2008 (UTC) Barcelona Búfals Gijón Mariners Granada Lions Sevilla Linces Valencia Firebats LNFA LNFA 2 Philadelphia Quakers (AFL) - scraped clean and started anew. History is looking better, but I need another pair of eyes regarding the format. Any volunteers (please)? B.Wind (talk) 05:33, 24 May 2008 (UTC) Boston Bulldogs (AFL) - scraped clean and started anew. B.Wind (talk) 04:59, 24 May 2008 (UTC) Cleveland Panthers - another article about an AFL I franchise that had no fewer than 12 players who had NFL careers. (Note: Cookie Cunningham is in dire need of an article, either from this WikiProject or WikiProject Basketball) B.Wind (talk) 05:56, 21 May 2008 (UTC) Newark Bears (AFL) - just-written article on the first casualty of the first AFL-NFL war (in 1926). B.Wind (talk) 17:59, 19 May 2008 (UTC) Los Angeles Wildcats - posted today by me. B.Wind (talk) 06:22, 17 May 2008 (UTC) Template:American football club - a generic version of the NFL team and CFL team infoboxes, which hopefully could be used on articles for teams outside these two major leagues. Bettia (talk) 08:50, 21 April 2008 (UTC) American Association (football) - posted yesterday by me. Relies heavily on one source - more are needed. B.Wind (talk) 05:46, 20 April 2008 (UTC) Los Angeles Bulldogs - created today by me. Could use a picture or two, and scanning by another pair of eyes. B.Wind (talk) 04:52, 17 April 2008 (UTC) Pacific Coast Professional Football League - created yesterday by me. Could use another pair of eyes or three since I'm dyslexic. B.Wind (talk) 03:56, 7 April 2008 (UTC) List of American football stadiums by capacity - created today by me Willy turner 01:58, 31 March 2007 (UTC) Collaboration and review[edit] Collaboration of the week Peer review List of American football teams in the United Kingdom Israeli Football League - It would be great if someone who is familiar with the standard styles and table-formats for NFL articles could brush this up. Also the assessment should be from the perspective of a US NFL fan. (apologies if I'm putting this req in the wrong place.) Joe407 (talk) 16:38, 16 March 2010 (UTC) Assessment Hampshire Thrashers - I've just given this page a total revamp and I'd appreciate a rating and some suggestions on any possible improvements. Ta very much. B e t t i a ♦ t a k i l 16:02, 27 February 2008 (UTC) Edinburgh Wolves - Would be apprecative of anything else anyone can think of to improve this. Working on getting more refs at the mo.
