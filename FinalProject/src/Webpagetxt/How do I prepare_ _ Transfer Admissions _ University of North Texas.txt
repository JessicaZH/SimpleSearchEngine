Credit for vocational work may be accepted if you are pursuing a BAAS degree. For information, call our Veterans Center at 940-369-2681 or visit the Student Veterans Services website. GPA transfers At UNT, you’ll have three GPAs: An overall Transferring GPA used for admission to UNT* A Cumulative UNT GPA that determines your UNT student status A Graduating GPA that includes all work (Transfer Work, plus UNT combined GPA) that determines your eligibility to apply for graduation from UNT and to graduate with honors *If you have an "incomplete" on your transcript, it won’t be calculated in your Transferring GPA for admission purposes.

Certain departments may require a grade of C or higher in specific core courses.
