Heteroatom - Wikipedia Heteroatom From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Pyridine is a heterocyclic compound and the heteroatom is nitrogen. In chemistry, a heteroatom (from Ancient Greek heteros, "different", + atomos, "uncut") is, strictly, any atom that is not carbon or hydrogen.[1] In practice, the term is usually used more specifically, to indicate that non-carbon atoms have replaced carbon in the backbone of the molecular structure. Typical heteroatoms are nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), and iodine (I).[2][3] It can also be used with highly specific meanings in specialised contexts. In the description of protein structure, in particular in the Protein Data Bank file format, a heteroatom record (HETATM) describes an atom as belonging to a small molecule cofactor rather than being part of a biopolymer chain.[4] In the context of zeolites, the term heteroatom refers to partial isomorphous substitution of the typical framework atoms (silicon, aluminium, and phosphorus) by other elements such as beryllium, vanadium, and chromium.[5] The goal is usually to adjust properties of the material (e.g., Lewis acidity) to optimize the material for a certain application (e.g., catalysis).
