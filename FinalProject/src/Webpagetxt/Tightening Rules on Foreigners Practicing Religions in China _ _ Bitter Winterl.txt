The existing regulations, enforced in 1991, prohibit Chinese citizens from attending gatherings organized by foreign religious groups and ban such organizations from venues, which were not authorized for religious purposes. Foreigners, if not backed by the State, may not preach, teach or train Chinese religious staff and believers, nor can they produce or sell religious products and supplies, including books. The State Administration of Religious Affairs started consultations this week to further restrict these rules, targeting “collective religious activities” of more than 50 people, organized and attended by foreigners. The trial of a Protestant pastor in the southwestern province of Guizhou, accused of “intentionally disclosing state secrets,” served as a pretext to organize the consultations on tighter rules.
