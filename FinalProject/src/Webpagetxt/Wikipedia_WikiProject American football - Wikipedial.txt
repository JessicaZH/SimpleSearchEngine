Please see the talk page to join the discussion on this. Once a general consensus is reached there, those guidelines should be moved here. Disambiguation[edit] Wikipedia:Naming conventions (sportspeople)#Gridiron football Open tasks[edit] The primary task now is to decide the direction for this project, and establish a set of guidelines as to WHAT this project will work on and HOW we will format articles, categories, etc. This discussion is happening on the talk page. Once a consensus is reached there, a to-do list can be developed. Diagrams (in .PNG format) are currently being uploaded for formations, plays, and positions. Check out: Formation (American football) for examples.

Why doesn't the receiving team simply decline to touch the ball and take possesion wherever the ball comes to rest? Quarterback is in desperate need of cited sources and (most likely) cleanup Merge : * Flag football, touch football, and street football all exist as problematic articles independent of one another. I'd like to see discussion on whether the three should be merged into a single article under flag football or just addressed under American_football#Variations_and_related_sports. They are very problematic articles because there is no uniform set of rules or notable leagues, but well-meaning editors all over the country often think that their local rules or league are standard or notable.
