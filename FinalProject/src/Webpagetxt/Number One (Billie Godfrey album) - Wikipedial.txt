(March 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Number One Studio album by Billie Godfrey Released September 5, 2001 Genre Pop Length 44:40 Label Jvc Victor Producer Mark Summers Number One is the first full-length studio album released by the British singer Billie Godfrey, in 2001. Godfrey sings entirely in Japanese despite not being a native Japanese speaker - something no other western artist has so far achieved.[1] It was released in Japan but also sold in the UK and US as an import.[2] The concept for the album was conceived and produced by Mark Summers for his music label Scorccio Records (now known as Scorccio Sample Replays). His vision was to produce Pop and R&B songs for the Japanese market, to be sung in Japanese - but sung by a native English vocalist. The English written songs were all translated into Japanese by musician Emiko Kawakami, following this Summers and Godfrey booked 5 days at a West London studio to record all the vocals for the album.[citation needed] Within the first hour of recording, it soon became apparent how difficult it was for anyone non-Japanese to read the translated text and sing it fluently.[citation needed] Mark Summers then quickly devised a phonetic technique for Billie Godfrey - to be able to sing as if she was fluent in Japanese, which most listeners in Japan believed she truly was.[citation needed] Track listing[edit] Number One Day By Day I'm - Lovin' You Sweet Dreaming Something I Can Keep Liberar Vida When U Were With Me Who Knows Always Intergroove Heaven & Earth Intergroove # 2 Number One - Scorccio Remix I'm - Lovin' You (Reprise) References[edit] ^ Scorccio Records ^ Discogs - Billie Godfrey External links[edit] http://www.billiegodfrey.com/ Retrieved from "https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Number_One_(Billie_Godfrey_album)&oldid=865735738" Categories: 2001 albums Japanese-language albums Hidden categories: Articles needing additional references from March 2010 All articles needing additional references Articles with hAudio microformats All articles with unsourced statements Articles with unsourced statements from March 2010 Navigation menu Personal tools Not logged in Talk Contributions Create account Log in Namespaces Article Talk Variants Views Read Edit View history More Search Navigation Main page Contents Featured content Current events Random article Donate to Wikipedia Wikipedia store Interaction Help About Wikipedia Community portal Recent changes Contact page Tools What links here Related changes Upload file Special pages Permanent link Page information Wikidata item Cite this page Print/export Create a book Download as PDF Printable version Languages Add links This page was last edited on 25 October 2018, at 20:18 (UTC).
