Category:User essays - Wikipedia Help Category:User essays From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search "Wikipedia:User essays" redirects here. For a description of user essays, see Wikipedia:Essays. For the Wikiproject related to Wikipedia essays including user essays, see Wikipedia:WikiProject Essays. This is a maintenance category. It is used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project and is not part of the encyclopedia. It contains pages that are not articles, or it groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories. This category contains essays in the User namespace about Wikipedia and related topics. A user may decide to categorize their essay here for more exposure. To add a page to this category, use template {{Essay}} (not one of its variants – this one auto-categorizes for you). Except for necessary maintenance (like correcting categories or removing images without a fair-use rationale), you should generally not edit essays that reside in someone else's userspace without the user's permission. An essay here may be moved categorically by its author into the Wikipedia namespace, Category:Wikipedia essays, if it is frequently referenced, as evidenced by becoming an evolving expression of multiple editors, or if the user wishes to relinquish editorial control of it to the community (and the essay was not userspaced as the result of a community decision). Additional essays may be found in the WMF-wide meta:Category:Essays. For non-Wikipedia-related essays, as article topics, see Category:Essays. See also Category:Wikidiaries.
