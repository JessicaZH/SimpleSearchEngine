Home Public Stack Overflow Tags Users Jobs Teams+Slack Q&A for work Learn More Angular 4 wrapping components with _ngcontent-cx divs Ask Question up vote 1 down vote favorite 1 I have an ngFor loop in one of my Angular templates that includes another component, here's a snippet: <div *ngFor="let thing of things" (click)="onClick($event, thing)">
    <app-thing [data]="thing"></app-thing>
</div>
 and Angular is wrapping each app-thing with a div containing an attribute called _ngcontent_c4 as follows: <div _ngcontent_c4>
    <app-thing...>
        <!-- ... -->
    </app-thing>
</div>
<div _ngcontent_c4>
    <app-thing...>
        <!-- ... -->
    </app-thing>
</div>
<div _ngcontent_c4>
    <app-thing...>
        <!-- ... -->
    </app-thing>
</div>
<!-- ... --->
 The parent div wrapper is causing issues, especially with styling, and making it harder to use the :host selector to style the component itself. I had to move some styling outside the :host to target the parent to get my flexbox layout working properly. Is there a way to get Angular not to wrap components? angular angular2-template share|improve this question asked Apr 19 '17 at 8:13 josef.van.niekerk 6,1231572136 add a comment | 2 Answers 2 active oldest votes up vote 3 down vote accepted Instead of iterating the components within a div, rather iterate the component itself, this will apply (this) styles. <div *ngFor="let thing of things" (click)="onClick($event, thing)">
    <app-thing [data]="thing"></app-thing>
</div>
 Rather do this: <app-thing *ngFor="let thing of things" (click)="onClick($event, thing)" [data]="thing"></app-thing>
 This will make styling easier, and will keep your styles within its component, like you intended it to. share|improve this answer answered Apr 19 '17 at 8:29 Levarne Sobotker 700810 add a comment | up vote 3 down vote You can control how Angular applies styles to your components by seting encapsulation property in component metadata: @Component({
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None,
})
export class Component {}
 ViewEncapsulation.None will not add extra attributes. Check ViewEncapsulation and Component Styles in docs for more info. share|improve this answer answered Apr 19 '17 at 8:20 Sasxa 26.4k107192 add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Stack Overflow!
