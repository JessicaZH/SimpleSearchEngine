After the Church manifested its dissatisfaction with the government’s decision, its water supply was cut off and the elevators were put out of service. The government’s persecution of Zion Church has now escalated. The landlord of the church, the local residential committee, and the local police station keep pressuring and threatening the Church claiming that this religious group is a cult. On May 17, the Church received a notice from the property management center that, after the lease expires in August the center was not going to renew it for another five years as they previously agreed. The prospect of this Church that hosts over 1,500 people is worrying.
