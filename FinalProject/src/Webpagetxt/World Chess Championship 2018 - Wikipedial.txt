The 12-game match, organised by FIDE and its commercial partner Agon, was played at The College in Holborn, London, between 9 and 28 November 2018.[2][3] The classical time-control portion of the match ended with 12 consecutive draws, the only time in the history of the world chess championship that all classical games have been drawn.[4] On 28 November, rapid chess was used as a tie-breaker; Carlsen won three consecutive games to retain his title.

Championship match[edit] 2018 World Chess Championship logo showing 5 overlapping arms above chessboard holding or moving chess pieces. The College, in London Holborn, formerly the Central School of Art and Design. The venue for the World Chess Championship 2018. The Championship match between Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana was held from 9 to 28 November 2018 in London, United Kingdom, at The College in Holborn. Match regulations[edit] The match was organised in a best-of-12-games format. The time control for the games was 100 minutes for the first 40 moves, an additional 50 minutes added after the 40th move, and then an additional 15 minutes added after the 60th move, plus an additional 30 seconds per move starting from move 1. Players were not permitted to agree to a draw before Black's 30th move.[9][10] The tie-breaking method consisted of the following schedule of faster games played on the final day in the following order, as necessary: Best-of-four rapid games (25 minutes for each player with an increment of 10 seconds after each move). The player with the best score after four rapid games is the winner. The players are not required to record the moves. In the match, Carlsen immediately won three games in a row, securing the championship. If the rapid games had been tied 2–2, up to five mini-matches of best-of-two blitz games (5 minutes plus 3 seconds increment after each move) would have been played. The player with the best score in any two-game blitz match would be the winner. If the blitz matches had failed to produce a winner, one sudden death "Armageddon" game: White receives 5 minutes and Black receives 4 minutes. Both players receive an increment of 3 seconds starting from move 61. The player who wins the drawing of lots may choose the colour. In case of a draw, the player with the black pieces is declared the winner.[11] Prize fund[edit] The prize fund was 1 million euros net of all applicable taxes. Had the match been decided in the classical portion it would have been divided 60% vs 40% between winner and loser. As the match went to a tie-break the split was more evenly at 55% vs 45%.[6][12] Previous head-to-head record[edit] Prior to the match, Caruana and Carlsen had played 33 games against each other at classical time controls, of which Carlsen won 10 and Caruana 5, with 18 draws.[13][14] The most recent game, during the 2018 Sinquefield Cup tournament, resulted in a draw.[15] Head-to-head record[14] Carlsen wins Draw Caruana wins Total Classical Carlsen (white) – Caruana (black) 5 10 2 17 Caruana (white) – Carlsen (black) 5 8 3 16 Total 10 18 5 33 Blitz / rapid / exhibition 13 4 6 23 Total 23 22 11 56 Alternative logo[edit] 2018 World Chess Championship alternative logo showing 2 figures with overlapping legs holding a chessboard in between with overlapping arms holding chess pieces. The World Chess Federation also showcased an "alternative logo", which depicts two figures with overlapping legs holding a chessboard. The image received controversy for appearing provocative and even "sexy". According to World Chess, this logo is "controversial and trendy, just like the host city", which is London.[16] When the head of World Chess, Ilya Merenzon, was asked to speak on the topic, he said that "it's about two people fighting", but later added that "it would be nice to bring a little bit of sexual appeal into chess".[17] Organisation and location[edit] The match was held under the auspices of FIDE, the world chess federation, with the organisation rights belonging to Agon, its commercial partner.[2] Following the previous championship match in 2016, the president of FIDE, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, said that the next venue would be in London or somewhere in Asia. Japan, South Korea and Singapore all said they were prepared to host the match.[18][19] In November 2017, London was revealed as the host.[20] The Chief arbiter was Stéphane Escafre from France, and deputy arbiter was Nana Alexandria from Georgia. The appeal committee was composed of International Grandmasters and was chaired by Alexander Beliavsky (Slovenia) with Nigel Short (England) and Jóhann Hjartarson (Iceland) also present. The FIDE Supervisor was Ashot Vardapetyan, an International Arbiter from Armenia. The match took place at The College in Holborn, Central London, an impressive Victorian building with a glass dome on the roof. The interior was refitted for the match to provide an elevated rectangular playing space that was to be sound-proof and set behind unidirectional glass—so that the players were separated from the audience—they could be seen, but they would not see the spectators who stood in near total darkness. To attend the event, ticket prices ranged from £45 to £100. It was also broadcast online, with IM Anna Rudolf and GM Judit Polgár providing commentary.[21][22][23] The first move of each game of the match was ceremonially performed by guests invited by the organisers. Among the guests were the previous title contestant, Sergey Karjakin, movie and TV celebrities, and representatives of the sponsors.[24] For the first five minutes of actual game time, photographers were allowed to remain in the playing space to take photos.[25] Live analysis[edit] The games were analysed live by the Sesse computer, running Stockfish.[26] The computer uses a 20-core 2.3GHz Haswell-EP CPU, which is significantly more powerful than standard computers, but not at supercomputer level. Match preparation video leak[edit] On 13 November 2018, a two-minute video showing Caruana's preparation for the match showing a list of openings, possibly revealing some of Caruana's opening preparation, was uploaded onto the Saint Louis Chess Club's YouTube channel. The video was quickly removed, but screen shots from the video were disseminated on the internet. They revealed that Caruana’s team were focussing on particular games, and openings—openings that deal primarily with how Caruana would defend as Black against 1. d4 or 1. e4; including variations of the Queen's Gambit Declined, Petrov's Defence, and the Grünfeld Defence with a fianchetto.[27][28] Schedule and results[edit] Days with games are shaded.

Kd2? and now 37...Rg3! also was winning but not played.[30] In game 1, Woody Harrelson made the ceremonial first move. In doing so, he "accidentally" knocked over White's king, indicating resignation; his attempt at humour was much criticized. The game was a 115-move draw, lasting 7 hours.[31] It was the fourth longest game in a world championship, after Game 5 of the 1978 championship (124 moves), Game 7 of the 2014 championship (122 moves), and Game 14 of the 1908 championship (119 moves). Caruana opened with 1.e4, and Carlsen responded with the Sicilian Defence, with Caruana playing the Rossolimo Variation, an opening with which he had lost against Carlsen in 2015.[32] After 15 moves, it was clear that Carlsen had won the opening duel, with White having no clear way to improve his position while Black still had plans. Caruana started to consume a lot of time, but failed to neutralise Carlsen, with the result that Carlsen had a strong position after 30 moves and Caruana was in serious time trouble.[30] Carlsen had a winning position several times between moves 34 and 40 but, despite a significant time advantage, failed each time to find the winning continuation, and after 40...Bxc3? Caruana was able to reach a drawn endgame. Carlsen continued to play for a win but Caruana was able to hold the game, despite being a pawn down in a rook and pawns versus rook and pawns endgame. The game lasted for seven hours before the players agreed to a draw. 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. h3 Nf6 7. Nc3 Nd7 8. Be3 e5 9. 0-0 b6 10. Nh2 Nf8 11. f4 exf4 12.

Bh5+ Kg8 20. e4 would have recovered material, though neither player thought it offered white an advantage.[33] Game 2 began as a Queen's Gambit Declined with Caruana opting for the rarely played 10...Rd8. Caught by surprise, Carlsen avoided the most critical continuation and soon found himself far behind on the clock,[34] a reversal of fortunes from Game 1. Caruana was clearly in the driver's seat, but Carlsen was able to "beg for a draw",[34] successfully navigating to a drawn pawn-down rook endgame. The game was drawn by agreement in 49 moves. 1.d4 Nf6 2. Nf3 d5 3. c4 e6 4. Nc3 Be7 5. Bf4 0-0 6. e3 c5 7. dxc5 Bxc5 8. Qc2 Nc6 9. a3 Qa5 10. Rd1 Rd8 11.

Here, Caruana (white) could have exchanged the first pair of rooks with 15. Rxa5 Qxa5 16. Bd2 Qc7 17. Qa1 and begun to apply pressure on the queenside and the position would have become slightly more unpleasant for Carlsen.[35] Game 3 was a 49-move draw, beginning again with the Rossolimo Variation of the Sicilian Defence. Caruana deviated first with 6. 0-0, against which Carlsen chose a rare continuation. White maintained some pressure, but it was not serious. On move 15 Caruana suffered a "blackout" and played Bd2, missing that Black does not have to exchange rooks. This lost all the White pressure, and a few moves later with neither side having any concrete plan, Caruana exchanged all the major pieces and went into a slightly inferior endgame, where Black possessed a bishop for White's knight as well as a slight space advantage. Carlsen tried, but Caruana was never in real danger of losing.[35][36] 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 g6 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. d3 Bg7 6. 0-0 Qc7 7. Re1 e5 8. a3 Nf6 9. b4 0-0 10. Nbd2 Bg4 11. h3 Bxf3 12.

White is in the midst of a queenside minority attack, and this was his only chance to play 15. b5 before black stops it with Bd7. Carlsen may have been concerned about 15. b5 cxb5 16. axb5 a5, giving black a passed pawn. GM Sam Shankland felt that White's position is more comfortable, but that after 17. Qa4 Qe7 18. Rfc1 Bf5! intending e4 with piece exchanges, a draw is still the most likely result.[37] Game 4 was a 34-move draw that began with the English Opening, Four Knights, Kingside Fianchetto variation. Carlsen came up with the first new move, 11. b4, but Caruana was prepared with the immediate rejoinder 11...Bd6. Several logical moves later Carlsen had the opportunity to create an imbalanced position with 15. b5, but declined (see diagram). After 15...Bd7 stopping the pawn break, it became difficult for either side to come up with concrete plans, and the game was soon drawn.[37] This was only the second time Carlsen opened with c4 in a world championship match, the first being a victory against Viswanathan Anand in game 5 in 2013. 1.c4 e5 2.

Carlsen had many ways to go wrong earlier, but had successfully avoided all the traps and now initiates a forced line that leads to a comfortable endgame for Black. Game 5 was a 34-move draw, beginning once again with the Rossolimo Variation of the Sicilian Defence. This time play transitioned to the little-used Gurgenidze variation, which was prepared by Caruana before this match began, forcing Carlsen to spend a lot of time thinking early on.[38] In fact, the variation with 7. ...a6 was last played at the top level in 2007.[39] It was not until 13. ...Qa5 that Caruana began to seriously think about his next move.[38] Although Caruana had caught Carlsen in his preparation, Carlsen navigated the complications accurately, and emerged not only unscathed, but with a slightly superior position.[40] Nonetheless, Caruana was able to defend without many problems, and the players agreed to a draw after the 34th move. 1.e4 c5 2.

However, the variation was so subtle that Garry Kasparov wrote that no human could have found it.[41] Game 6 was an 80-move draw. Carlsen began with 1. e4, while Caruana defended with the Petrov Defence, one of his favourite openings. Both players blitzed out the opening, reaching a dry and drawish middlegame. However, Carlsen played somewhat carelessly and Caruana was able to sharpen the position by opening the center. By move 26 it was apparent that Black was for choice. Carlsen defended by giving up a knight for three pawns, two of which were connected passed pawns on the queenside, and forced an opposite-color bishops endgame. Caruana was able to take one of the pawns, but Carlsen had strong counterplay and it was unclear how Caruana could make progress. On move 67 Carlsen made a subtle error that allowed Caruana a forced mate in 30 moves, found by Sesse. However, the line was so subtle that even grandmasters had trouble explaining the idea after the game. After this last opportunity Carlsen made no further mistakes and held the draw.[42][43][41] 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nd3 Nxe4 5. Qe2 Qe7 6. Nf4 Nc6 7. Nd5 Nd4 8. Nxe7 Nxe2 9. Nd5 Nd4 10.

White has the chance to push forward with 15. Nce4, but after 15...Bd7, it is not easy for White to recapture the c4-pawn since 16.Nxc4 Rfc8 gives Black's pieces enough activity that White still has no advantage.[44] For Game 7, Carlsen once again had the white pieces (the order switched at the halfway point) and he repeated the Queen's Gambit Declined of game 2. The first nine moves followed game 2, until Carlsen deviated with 10.Nd2. However, Caruana was well-prepared and had his counter ready. Carlsen temporarily sacrificed a pawn to exert some pressure on the Black kingside, but when the opportunity arose to open the game with 15. Nce4 (diagram) – which would have compromised Black's king position but made it awkward to recapture the sacrificed pawn – he didn't sufficiently believe in his position to press ahead. Carlsen later said that playing 15. 0-0 was an admission that White had no advantage. After White recaptured the sacrificed pawn the position was symmetrical. Carlsen made some attempt to win the game, but although he was able to establish an outpost for his knight on d6, he had to trade every other piece to achieve it, and the game fizzled to a draw on move 40.[44] 1.d4 Nf6 2.

White can continue a promising attack with 24. Nc4 or 24. Qh5. However, White played 24. h3? which was too slow and allowed Black to mount an effective defence beginning with 24...Qe8! The queen manoeuvres to g6, guarding both the h5- and d6-squares and stopping all of White's attacking ideas.[45] In Game 8 Caruana had the white pieces and once again opened with 1.e4. Just like the other three games before in this situation, Carlsen responded with the Sicilian Defence. Unlike the previous three games, Caruana played an Open Sicilian. Carlsen responded with the Sveshnikov Variation. By move 20 the position was very open and sharp with Black's king feeling a little exposed. Caruana found the very good 21.c5!, sacrificing a pawn to further open the center and create a passed 'd' pawn. Engine analysis showed this position to be winning for White. Unfortunately for Caruana, 23.Rad1 was a little too slow for this position (23.Rae1 seizing the open e-file immediately was preferred, although some engines disagreed) and 24.h3? gave away all of his advantage. Four-time U.S. champion Hikaru Nakamura reacted immediately and negatively to 24.h3, with disapproving facial expressions and harsh comments that he didn't like the move at all.[46] Eight-time Russian champion and chess commentator Peter Svidler was also shocked by the move, suggesting this move was an attempt by White to deny Black any counter-play by preventing him from advancing his g-pawn,[47] but engine analysis showed the position to be equal after Carlsen responded with 24. ...Qe8. Caruana soon realised that he had lost his advantage, and forced a draw before Black's bishop pair and extra pawn could make an impact.[48] Play eventually ended after 38 moves in a draw after 3 hours and 43 minutes of play, with equal material and Caruana unable to promote his passed 'd' pawn.[45] 1.e4 c5 2.

White enjoys a positional advantage and can continue a slow buildup of pressure with 25. Bc6, 25. Bf3 or 25. Kg2, although Black might still be able to set up a fortress with ...h5, ...f5, ...Kg7 and ...Qf6. Instead, White rushed to break open Black's kingside with 25. h5? This move allowed Black the surprising resource of 25...gxh5! 26. Qc4 f5! 27. Bf3 h4! Black was now safe and the game proceeded to rook and queen exchanges and a drawn opposite-coloured bishops ending.[49] Game 9 began with the English Opening, Four Knights, Kingside Fianchetto variation, following Game 4 until Carlsen deviated with 9. Bg5. Although Black's position was not terrible, it soon became clear that White had much easier plans and Black didn't have much counterplay. As a result, Caruana played the exchange 17...Bxf3?! Sesse gave Carlsen a +0.75 advantage after this move, which was also criticised by human commentators such as U.S. grandmaster Robert Hess.[50] However, both Caruana and Carlsen later defended the move. While it leads to a lasting and comfortable White advantage, Black manages to simplify the position, as well as the chance to reach an opposite-coloured bishops endgame.[49] After the exchanges, White had good attacking chances, thanks to a safer king and opposite-coloured bishops.[49] Carlsen advanced his h-pawn, trying to pry open Black's king position. However, 25. h5? was too hasty, and Caruana responded with 25...gxh5! followed by pawn thrusts 26...f5! and 27...h4! that also exposed White's king. Black now had enough counterplay and the two players exchanged off rooks and queens into a drawn opposite-coloured bishops endgame. Carlsen kept playing on but there was never any realistic hope for a win unless Caruana blundered catastrophically.[49] With this draw, the match set a new record for most consecutive draws to begin a World Championship match. The 1995 Classical match began with eight consecutive draws before Viswanathan Anand broke through against Garry Kasparov for a win.[49] 1.c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. Nf3 Nc6 4. g3 d5 5. cxd5 Nxd5 6.

Black has a menacing number of pieces and pawns lined up against White's king. If White plays 22.axb6 e.p., Black trades rooks and removes a defender of the f3-square for a later f3 pawn thrust. Although not necessarily winning, the attack is psychologically frightening.[51] This game began with the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian Defence, and followed Game 8 until Caruana deviated with 12. b4. The game entered a complicated middlegame where both sides had a lot of possibilities, and then became even more complicated when Carlsen played 21...b5! Both sides took risks and it was possible that either side could win, with Black launching a strong kingside attack while White gained a passed pawn on the queenside, a potential endgame trump if he survives the attack. Carlsen was able to force Caruana to weaken his king position, but was not able to break through the pawn shield. Although the attack failed, Carlsen had forced White's pieces to passive squares, and was able to neutralise White's passed b-pawn as a result. After Carlsen liquidated the b-pawn, Caruana emerged with an extra pawn in the endgame, but there were too few pawns remaining for White to hope to break through.[51] 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 e5 6.Ndb5 d6 7.Nd5 Nxd5 8.exd5 Nb8 9.a4 Be7 10.Be2 0-0 11.0-0 Nd7 12.b4 a6 13.Na3 a5 14.bxa5 Rxa5 15.Nc4 Ra8 16.Be3 f5 17.a5 f4 18.Bb6 Qe8 19.Ra3 Qg6 20.Bc7 e4 21.Kh1 b5 (diagram) 22.Nb6 Nxb6 23.Bxb6 Qg5 24.g3 b4 25.Rb3 Bh3 26.Rg1 f3 27.Bf1 Bxf1 28.Qxf1 Qxd5 29.Rxb4 Qe6 30.Rb5 Bd8 31.Qe1 Bxb6 32.axb6 Rab8 33.Qe3 Qc4 34.Rb2 Rb7 35.Rd1 Qe2 36.Re1 Qxe3 37.Rxe3 d5 38.h4 Rc8 39.Ra3 Kf7 40.Kh2 Ke6 41.g4 Rc6 42.Ra6 Ke5 43.Kg3 h6 44.h5 Kd4 45.Rb5 Rd6 46.Ra4+ Ke5 47.Rab4 Ke6 48.c4 dxc4 49.Rxc4 Rdxb6 50.Rxe4+ Kf7 51.Rf5+ Rf6 52.Rxf6+ Kxf6 53.Kxf3 Kf7 54.Kg3 ½–½ Game 11: Carlsen–Caruana, ½–½[edit] Carlsen–Caruana, game 11 a b c d e f g h 8 8 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 a b c d e f g h Position after 18...Ne5! White has no way to avoid the opposite-coloured bishop endgame, which also kills all his winning chances. In Game 11, the first move was ceremonially performed by the previous challenger of the title, Sergey Karjakin. Carlsen opened with e4 for the second time in the match, with Caruana once again playing Petrov's Defence. Caruana was very well prepared, and Carlsen was unable to get an opening advantage, despite the fact the variation with 9. ...Nf6 being visible in the leaked opening preparation video. After an early queen trade, Caruana forced an opposite-coloured bishops endgame with 18...Ne5! After further liquidating the d6-pawn, his only weakness, Caruana even had the liberty to give up a pawn. Carlsen kept playing, but his only chance to win was for Caruana to blunder, which he did not.[52] The game was drawn in 55 moves. 1.e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nf6 3. Nxe5 d6 4. Nf3 Nxe4 5. Nc3 Nxc3 6. dxc3 Be7 7.

White is clearly under pressure, while Black threatens both the lethal pawn break 29...b5 as well as the very strong 29...Ba4. However after 29...a4? 30. Qb4! the pawn break is stopped, costing Black most of his advantage. Black could still prepare the advance with ...Bd7 or ...Rcb8, but Carlsen elected to offer a draw to focus on the tie-breaks instead. This game began with the Sveshnikov Variation of the Sicilian Defence, and followed Games 8 and 10 until Carlsen deviated with 8...Ne7. The game entered a complicated middlegame which Carlsen showed better understanding of than Caruana. Former world champions Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik both disapproved of Caruana's 18. f3 and 21. Rh2 idea, thinking that it just created weaknesses for Black to play against. Indeed, Carlsen was able to quickly push his central pawn majority while stalling Caruana's queenside. By move 25 he had a better position. However, Carlsen was unwilling to take risks. He did not play the challenging 25...b5, opting for the more prudent 25...a5 instead. Although White's position remained miserable, after 29...a4? Caruana was able to place his queen on b4 and stop the b5 pawn thrust. Black still had a superior position and a clear plan while White remained passive, but Carlsen offered a draw, opting to go to the tiebreaks.[53] It surprised some that the game ended with Carlsen having a stable long-term advantage with no risks, as well as more time on the clock. Kramnik was especially critical, saying he was shocked that Carlsen could decline to play on. At the press conference, Carlsen explained his decision with an earlier recommendation of his team to avoid any potential risks.[54] 1.e4 c5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4 Nf6 5. Nc3 e5 6. Ndb5 d6 7.

Rcd1. Caruana played 19...Nb5?, after which his position was collapsing with 20. Nc5 Rxb2 and the ensuing exchanges. Instead, the retreat 19...Nb7 offered better chances to hold the position.[56] The game began with the English Opening as with Games 4 and 9, with Carlsen deviating with 3. g3, entering the Bremen, Smyslov system. Carlsen offered the c4-pawn for more active queenside play, and, by move 12, had compromised Black's queenside pawn structure. By Black's 25th move, Carlsen was able to regain the sacrificed pawn and trade into an endgame with an extra pawn. Caruana's 37... Kxe4 mistake[56] allowed Carlsen to create two connected, passed pawns on the King's side and win the game. 1.c4 e5 2. Nc3 Nf6 3. g3 Bb4 4. e4 0-0 5. Nge2 c6 6.
