From April 1 to 21, the police raided this church a dozen times hoping to capture the priest and nuns. They also displayed banners about the crackdown on religious belief around the church. According to local sources, at about 7 a.m. on April 1, six policemen from Huiguo police station raided this church intending to arrest the priest. The priest and the nuns had gotten the news beforehand and had successfully escaped. At about 9 a.m. that morning, about ten police cars arrived at the church. Dozens of police officers broke into the church and confiscated 6 to 7 big bundles of religious books, as well as tables, chairs, benches, books, computers, stereo equipment, and the priest’s bed. On the same day, the power supply for the church was cut off, the police locked it down and sealed it off. Over the next two days, the policemen raided the church several times again, hoping to capture the priest but failed. Afterward, the police threatened the onlookers by saying: “From now on, nobody is allowed on this ground.” In the afternoon of April 21, policemen from Huiguo police station entered the sealed-off church and confiscated the remaining items (tables, chairs, beds, etc.). They posted a notice about the methods of reporting illegal religious activities in Huiguo town on the gate of the church encouraging the local residents to report on church personnel. It has also been reported that, in early April, the Deputy Party Secretary of Zhengzhou came to Huiguo town to carry out the crackdown and ordered the policemen to arrest local Christians.
