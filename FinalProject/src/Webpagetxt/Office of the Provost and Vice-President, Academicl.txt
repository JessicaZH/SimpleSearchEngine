Every civilization has its knowledge-keepers; those who are given the opportunity in society to record history and create institutional memory, who instruct the young in methods and processes that build social cohesion and civic engagement, and who are given the time to create new knowledge and creative expressions. In Western liberal democracies, that task has largely been entrusted to the public academe, an institution that can trace its roots back to 900 AD, but which now has a very forward orientation. At the University of Windsor, we take this trust very seriously. We are a vibrant community of scholars dedicated to research, teaching, creative activity, and service to Windsor and Essex County. Our endeavours have local, national, and international reach. We strive to provide an enriching student experience, one that our graduates value because it gives them the skills for life, good citizenship and global engagement. I invite you to view this website, learn about the many initiatives, successes, and challenges we embrace to fulfil our mission as a public institution of high learning.

This mission, and these commitments, form the basis of our work and our decision making. Three key priorities provide focal points for sustainable advancement of this mission: Reputation Projects and initiatives that seek to ensure that excellence and innovation in all areas of the University’s academic mission is recognized, rewarded, and promoted, on and off campus, and around the world. Recruitment Projects and initiatives – from new programs, to extraordinary experiences, to enhanced graduate opportunities, from evolving research synergies to community engagement, from new communications strategies to stronger networks – that draw scholars, students, and staff and community members to the University of Windsor. Retention Projects and initiatives committed to ensuring that students, staff, and faculty can achieve their aspirations, and thrive and excel in all aspects of their learning, work, and life on campus. Projects that help people engage, persevere, and succeed. share tweet save +1 share tweet save +1 Contact Us University Directory Accessibility News Services for Media UWindsor mobile apps Terms & Conditions Emergency Services for Students Follow us on Twitter Follow us on Facebook Follow us on LinkedIn Follow us on Flickr Follow us on Youtube Follow us on Instagram
