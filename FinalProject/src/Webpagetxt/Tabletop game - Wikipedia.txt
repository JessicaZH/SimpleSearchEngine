Tabletop game - Wikipedia Tabletop game From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Chess has been a popular board game for centuries Tabletop games are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice games, miniatures wargames or tile-based games.[1][2] Contents 1 Classification according to equipment used 2 Classification according to elements of chance 3 Organizations 4 In culture 5 See also 6 References Classification according to equipment used[edit] Tabletop games can be classified according to the general form, or equipment utilized:[3] Game category Game examples Adventure games Adventure board games, Adventure gamebooks Board games Backgammon, Can't Stop, Chess, German-style board games, Go, Reversi Card games Solitaire, Collectible card games, Hanafuda, Tarot card games Dice games Bunco, Craps, Farkle, Generala, Poker dice, Sic bo, Yahtzee, Zombie Dice Paper and pencil games Battleship, Connect 5, Dots and Boxes, Hangman, Sprouts, Sudoku Role-playing games Call of Cthulhu, Dungeons & Dragons, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Strategy games Board wargames, Government simulation games, Miniature wargames Tile-based games 15 puzzle, Anagrams, Dominoes, Mahjong, Mahjong solitaire, Tangrams Games like chess and draughts are examples of games belonging to the board game category. Other games, however, use various attributes and cannot be classified unambiguously (e.g. Monopoly utilises a board as well as dice and cards). For several of these categories there are sub-categories and even sub-sub-categories or genres. For instance, German-style board games, board wargames, and Roll-and-move games are all types of board games that differ markedly in style and general interest. Classification according to elements of chance[edit] As an alternative to classifying games by equipment, they can also be classified according to the elements of chance involved. In game theory, two fundamentally different elements of chance can play a role: Chance due to outcome uncertainty, e.g. due to dice rolls or due to unknown cards being dealt during the game. Games in which outcome uncertainty plays a role are referred to as stochastic games as opposed to deterministic games. Chance due to state uncertainty, e.g. due to the opponent's position or cards not being visible, or due to the simultaneous move character of the game. Games in which state uncertainty plays a role are referred to as partial or imperfect information games as opposed to full or perfect information games. Examples of the chance classification for some well-known tabletop games are given in the table below.
