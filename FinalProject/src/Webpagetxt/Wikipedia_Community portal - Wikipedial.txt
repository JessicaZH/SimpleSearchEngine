We are developing a new generation of automated portals with better news feeds, picture displays, and auto-updating content. We're looking for creative editors to take part. If you'd like to try your hand at transclusion, templates, Lua, page layout, or you like to use wikitools, this project is for you. JavaScript programmers are also needed, to help the project understand what is possible. If you prefer small or repetitive tasks, join our elite squad of WikiGnomes. If you believe it is time to take content presentation on Wikipedia to the next level, we need you. Members receive updates on their talk pages to keep up with our rapid pace of development. A project is under way to add short descriptions to all articles. This is mainly for the benefit of mobile users searching Wikipedia. Help is welcomed – please visit WikiProject Short descriptions to learn more. Announcing SearchSuite. It provides user control over search results: it can strip them down to a single-spaced list, sort, and more. Most of its features are presented as menu item toggles to turn each feature on/off. Each menu-item-controlled feature works on the output of all the others, in both their on and off states. Feedback and feature suggestions welcome. Do you have need for a specialized script that doesn't exist yet, or have an idea for a cool new script or gadget? Post requests and ideas at Wikipedia:User scripts/Requests. Free subscriptions to high-quality paywalled journals, newspaper archives, and online reference works are available for Wikipedia editors. For more information, see Wikipedia:The Wikipedia Library/Databases Projects seeking help Also consider posting WikiProject, Task Force, and Collaboration news at the Signpost's WikiProject Report page.

Tip of the day Tip of the day... Brilliant pictures You probably know that Wikipedia's best articles become Featured Articles. But did you know that a similar process exists for images? Go to Featured Picture Candidates to help judge which images are both attractive and valuable to Wikipedia. Of course, the best can be found on featured pictures. Many of these photos are taken by Wikipedians. If you are a photographer, you can add yourself to the list, or encourage others by nominating great photos you come across. Feel free to use featured pictures in your own works (according to the terms on the image description page).
