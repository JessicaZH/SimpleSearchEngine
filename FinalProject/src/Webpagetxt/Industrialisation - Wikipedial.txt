Industrialisation - Wikipedia Industrialisation From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Jump to navigation Jump to search Further information: History of industrialisation The effect of industrialisation shown by rising income levels in the 19th century. The graph is showing that the gross national product (at purchasing power parity) per capita between 1750 and 1900 in 1990 US dollars for First World nations (Europe, United States, Canada, Japan) and Third World nations (Asia, Africa, Latin America).[1] Map showing the global distribution of industrial output[clarification needed] in 2005, based on a percentage of the top producing state, the United States Industrialisation or industrialization is the period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial society, involving the extensive re-organisation of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing.[2] As industrial workers' incomes rise, markets for consumer goods and services of all kinds tend to expand and provide a further stimulus to industrial investment and economic growth.

The invention of the assembly line gave this phase a boost. Coal mines, steelworks, and textile factories replaced homes as the place of work. [6][7][8] By the end of the 20th century, East Asia had become one of the most recently industrialised regions of the world.[9] The BRICS states (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) are undergoing the process of industrialisation.[10] There is considerable literature on the factors facilitating industrial modernisation and enterprise development.[11] Social consequences[edit] This section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (November 2010) Urbanisation[edit] Main article: Urbanisation As the Industrial Revolution was a shift from the agrarian society, hence people migrated from villages in search of jobs to places where factories were set up. This shifting of rural people led to urbanisation and rise in the population of the towns. The concentration of labour into factories has increased urbanisation and the size of settlements, to serve and house the factory workers. Exploitation[edit] Main articles: Exploitation of labour and Exploitation of natural resources Workers have to either leave their families or bring them along in order to work in the towns and cities where these industries are found. Changes in family structure[edit] The family structure changes with industrialisation. The sociologist Talcott Parsons noted that in pre-industrial societies there is an extended family structure spanning many generations who probably remained in the same location for generations. In industrialised societies the nuclear family, consisting of only parents and their growing children, predominates. Families and children reaching adulthood are more mobile and tend to relocate to where jobs exist. Extended family bonds become more tenuous.[12] Current situation[edit] This article may be confusing or unclear to readers. Please help us clarify the article.

The green, red, and blue components of the colours of the countries represent the percentages for the agriculture, industry, and services sectors respectively. As of 2018[update] the "international development community" (World Bank, Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), many United Nations departments, and some[which?] other organisations)[citation needed] endorses development policies like water purification or primary education and co-operation amongst third world communities.[13] Some members of the economic communities do not consider contemporary industrialisation policies as being adequate to the global south (Third World countries) or beneficial in the longer term, with the perception that they may only create inefficient local industries unable to compete in the free-trade dominated political order which industrialisation has fostered.[citation needed] Environmentalism and Green politics may represent more visceral reactions to industrial growth. Nevertheless, repeated examples in history of apparently successful industrialisation (Britain, Soviet Union, South Korea, China, etc) may make conventional industrialisation seem like an attractive or even natural path forward, especially as populations grow, consumerist expectations rise and agricultural opportunities diminish. The relationships among economic growth, employment, and poverty reduction are complex. Higher productivity, it is argued[by whom?], may lead to lower employment (see jobless recovery).[14] There are differences across sectors, whereby manufacturing is less able than the tertiary sector to accommodate both increased productivity and employment opportunities; more than 40% of the world's employees are "working poor", whose incomes fail to keep themselves and their families above the $2-a-day poverty line.[14] There is also a phenomenon of deindustrialisation, as in the former USSR countries' transition to market economies, and the agriculture sector is often the key sector in absorbing the resultant unemployment.[14] See also[edit] Automation Deindustrialization Division of labour Great Divergence Idea of Progress Mass production Mechanization Newly industrialised country References[edit] ^ Paul Bairoch (1995).
