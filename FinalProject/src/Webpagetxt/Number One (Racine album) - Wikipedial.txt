The band was fronted by Wendy James, who was notable for previously being the lead singer of the late 80's pop/rock band Transvision Vamp. After the disbandment of Transvision Vamp in the early 90's, Wendy James ventured into a short lived solo career, culminating in the release of her debut album Now Ain't the Time for Your Tears in 1993. The album was not a success and James dropped from the music scene for many years until re-establishing herself as an independent artist with new band Racine. The band, fronted and nurtured by James, also consisted of Singh Birdsong on guitar and Ray Sullivan on drums.[1] Number One was released in late September, 2004 and provided Wendy James with her first music release in over a decade. A single, "Grease Monkey" was released soon after.
