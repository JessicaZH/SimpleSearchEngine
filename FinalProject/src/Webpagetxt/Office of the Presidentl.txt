Our Mission Enabling people to make a better world through education, scholarship, research, and engagement. Welcome to the University of Windsor Since 1857, the historical origin of our present-day university, we have been a forward-looking community that has come together to study, to learn, to teach, and to serve. Our symbol is the bridge; our vista is cross-border; our commitment is local; and our impact is global. No other university in Canada can boast a location that is 600 metres away from a foreign country, an international neighbour, and a city with a French name: Detroit. We are a medium-sized community, but with access to a greater metropolitan area of more than 5 million people in two different countries, with exponential social and cultural opportunities. We are in that part of Canada once known as la nouvelle France, which explains our rich heritage of French place-names. Our campus is situated on the traditional territory of the Three Fires Confederacy of First Nations. We are the fourth most culturally and ethnically diverse city in all of Canada. What also makes us different is the range of programs we have – Engineering, Law, Nursing, Education, Business, Human Kinetics, Science, and Arts, Humanities & Social Sciences – in addition to signature programs that include Great Lakes research, the fine and performing arts, sport management, and dual degrees in Law on both sides of the Windsor-Detroit border. In fact, it is unusual, and a decided advantage, for a university of our size – about 16,000 this coming September – to have such a rich mix of programs – professional, applied, experiential, and theoretical. Our students have hands-on opportunities, both curricular and co-curricular, beginning in year one. And finally, I think what makes us so brilliantly, refreshingly unique is that we are a personalized, individualized campus. Wherever you’re from, and whether you’re a prospective student or parent, professor or staff member, alumnus or donor or friend, you will find in us a dynamic, inclusive community of higher learning whose history goes back more than 160 years and whose future is full of promise.
