Contents 1 Music video 2 Releases 3 References 4 External links Music video[edit] The video starts with Skye entering her room, throwing her guitar bag on the floor and getting on her bed. Skye then walks to her mirror-table, applying some eye liner. She then puts on a pink dress and starts singing. She can also be seen walking down a hallway with the same dress, holding and playing on a little pink guitar. When the song is nearly in the end, Skye removes the dress and enters a room, where she starts playing with her band.
