The problem I'm stuck on is: Find all prime and maximal ideals of $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_4$. I know that a finite integral domain is a field, which means the prime and maximal ideals are the same. That means I just have to find one or the other, right? But I don't really know how to go about finding ideals for $\mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m$. Any help would be great.

There aren't very many ideals to consider. – LASV Nov 21 '16 at 0:46 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote -2 down vote accepted An ideal of $Z_2 \times Z_4$ must have the form $I \times J$ where $I$ is an ideal of $Z_2$ and $J$ is an ideal of $Z_4$, both of which are not necessarily proper. So clearly there's not so much ideals to try! share|cite|improve this answer edited May 17 at 6:53 answered Nov 21 '16 at 15:30 chí trung châu 1,0691725 You should clarify that the ideals $I$, $J$ need not be proper -- one can be the whole ring. – Y.
