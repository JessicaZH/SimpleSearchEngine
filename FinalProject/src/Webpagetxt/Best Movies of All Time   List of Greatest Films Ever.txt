Best Movies Of All Time These are the best movies of all time, ranked by movie experts and film fans alike. What are the greatest movies of all time? This list of the top films ever made was created by taking best movie suggestions from Ranker users and letting them vote to determine which films are the best ever made. So, what are the best movies of all time? The list includes a wide range of films, from art house European cinema to top action films and blockbusters to established, highly-regarded classics of the Golden Age of Hollywood. The entries span many genres and include some of the greatest movie villains created by the best writers and top film directors in the industry. Included are movies that were recognized in their own time – including a number of Academy Award recipients and even Best Picture selections – as well as cult movies or sleeper hits that took time to find an audience. Shawshank Redemption, for example, was not highly regarded or popular in theaters when it first opened, but has since risen to the top of many best movie lists. If your favorite movies still aren't included with this group of the best movies of all time, add them by clicking "rerank" below to make your own list. Or just vote for the titles below that are most worthy of the title of the greatest movie ever.
