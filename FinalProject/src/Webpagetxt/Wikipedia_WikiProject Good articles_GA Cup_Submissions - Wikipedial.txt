Update your submission page. When you created your submission page, something like this should have pre-loaded: '''Nominations'''
{{Div col|cols=3}} 
#{{User:Dom497/GA Entry|status of article|article name|review number|-}}
{{Div col end}}

'''Reassessments'''
{{Div col|cols=3}} 
#{{User:Dom497/GAR Entry|article name|review number|-}}
{{Div col end}}
 For every review of a good article nomination you complete, you submit it by using the "GA Entry" template. Here is how to use the template: The status of article are: rev for "on review", pass if passed, and fail if failed. The name of the article is the exact name on Wikipedia, with no italics. The review number is the number accompanying the "GA" letters on the review page. E.g, if the review page is Talk:Alicia Keys/GA2, then the review number is 2. Example: #{{User:Dom497/GA Entry|fail|Alicia Keys|2|-}} produces: Alicia Keys (-) Please do not touch the |-}} section. This will be updated by a judge with the number of points earned after they look over your review. To add another entry, add the {{User:Dom497/GA Entry|...}} template between the {{Div col}} templates. For every thought/opinion that you leave for a reassessment, you use a similar template as above. The name of the article is the exact name on Wikipedia, with no italics. The review number is the number after the name of the article. E.g, if the review page is Wikipedia:Good article reassessment/Boeing 787 Dreamliner/1, then the review number is 1. Example: #{{User:Dom497/GAR Entry|Boeing 787 Dreamliner|1|-}} produces: Boeing 787 Dreamliner (-) Please do not touch the |-}} section. This will be updated by a judge with the number of points earned after they look over your review. To add another entry, add the {{User:Dom497/GAR Entry|...}} template between the {{Div col}} templates. All reviews will be reviewed by the judges to ensure the rules are being followed and that there are no "drive by" reviews. Please remember that quick fails and quick passes are worth 0 points. Quick passing may lead to disqualification. For nominations, judges will only award points to reviews that have the "status of article" parameter set to pass or fail. For reassessments, judges will award points after you add the entry to your list. In the event that you pass/fail a nomination after the round has ended, the points earned for that review will be added on to the next round (if you qualify). For reassessments, no matter how active you are in the reassessment, points will be awarded based off the date when you provided your opinion (with an explanation). If you provided your opinion during a break (the time between one round ending and the next round starting), the points will be carried over to the next round (if you qualify). Remember, if you are found to be abusing the rules, you will be given a warning. On your second offence, you will be disqualified.
