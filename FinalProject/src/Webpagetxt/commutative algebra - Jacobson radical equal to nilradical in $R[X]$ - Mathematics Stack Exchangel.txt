Let $\textrm{nilrad}(R)$ be the nilradical of $R$, which can be characterised either as the intersection of all prime ideals of $R$, or as the ideal of nilpotent elements. Let $J(R)$ be the Jacobson radical of $R$, which can be characterised either as the intersection of all maximal ideals of $R$ or as the ideal of elements $x\in R$ with the property that $1-xy$ is a unit for all $y\in R.$ In general, the nilradical of R is contained in the Jacobson radical. I want to show that the reverse inclusion holds in the polynomial ring $R[X].$ Can someone please give me a hint for this problem? Thank you. commutative-algebra share|cite|improve this question asked Mar 13 '13 at 8:58 Katie Dobbs 883717 1 Related to math.stackexchange.com/questions/153333/… – user26857 Mar 13 '13 at 11:24 add a comment | 1 Answer 1 active oldest votes up vote 8 down vote accepted Use the following elementary facts about polynomials: Let $f\in R[X]$, $f=a_0+a_1X+\cdots+a_nX^n$. Then $(1)$ $f$ is nilpotent iff $a_i$ is nilpotent for all $i\ge 0$; $(2)$ $f$ is invertible iff $a_0$ is invertible and $a_i$ is nilpotent for all $i\ge 1$. share|cite|improve this answer answered Mar 13 '13 at 10:20 user26857 See here for a much simpler approach, a la Euclid. – Bill Dubuque Jul 9 '14 at 13:14 add a comment | Your Answer Thanks for contributing an answer to Mathematics Stack Exchange!
