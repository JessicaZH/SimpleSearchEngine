Summary Review of what you've learned Shortcut WP:INTREF2 Play media A screencast that walks through the essentials needed in citing your sources If you've read many Wikipedia articles, then you've seen plenty of inline citations. These are usually small numbered footnotes like this.[1] They are generally added either directly following the fact they support, or at the end of the sentence they support, following any punctuation. When clicked, they take the reader to a full source in a reference section of the article. When editing a page using the popular (most common) footnotes style, inline citations are usually between <ref>...</ref> tags. Note the closing slash ("/") in the latter. The information within references is displayed together in one place on a page, wherever <references/> or, most commonly, the template, {{Reflist}} is present. This will usually be in a section titled "References". If you are creating a brand new page, or adding references to a page that didn't previously have any, don't forget to add a references section like the one below. The Manual of Style describes where to place such a section. == References ==
{{Reflist}}
 When an article has many citations it may be useful to display the references in columns. This can be done by a slight modification to the above code: use {{Reflist|30em}} instead of just {{Reflist}}. Note: This is by far the most popular system for inline citations, but sometimes you will find other styles being used in an article, such as references in parentheses. As a general rule, the first major contributor to an article gets to choose the referencing system used there. If an article uses a different system than the one you're used to, just copy an existing reference when adding any new reference, then modify it appropriately; don't mix styles.
