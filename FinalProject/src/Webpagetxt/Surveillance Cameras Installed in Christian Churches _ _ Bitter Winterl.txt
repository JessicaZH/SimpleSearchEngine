Recently, Bitter Winter learned that surveillance cameras have been installed in Christian churches in Zhejiang. In Beijing as well, surveillance cameras have been forcibly installed in the meeting places for house churches. In the middle of April, the authorities demanded to install surveillance cameras in Beijing Zion Church. After the community had manifested its dissatisfaction with the government’s decision, the church was faced with being cut off water supply and the elevators were put out of service.
