Introduced as centers where citizens will be submitted to mandatory education for learning areas of Chinese law they need to become familiar with, they became in fact a more secretive variant of the transformation through education camps. Nicknamed “black jails” by their victims, they are in fact detention centers where inmates are kept 24/7, are subjected to intense indoctrination, and totally deprived of personal freedom. There are credible claims that torture is also used. Political and religious dissidents, including members of The Church of Almighty God and Falun Gong practitioners are secretly detained there.
